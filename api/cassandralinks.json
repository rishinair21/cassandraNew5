        "content": "<header id=\"page-masthead\"><div id=\"page-content\"><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-6 col-md-offset-0 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2\"><div class=\"primary first-p-bold\"><h2>Overview</h2><p>This is the first in a series of blog post I’m planning to create as part of my prep for my Cassandra summit talk ‘Load Testing Cassandra Applications’.</p><p>cassandra-stress is a great utility for stress testing <a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/apache-cassandra/\">Cassandra</a>. However, available documentation is a little sparse and it not always entirely clear what load cassandra-stress will generate in a given situation. In this series of blog posts, I plan to walk through a number of cassandra stress scenarios examining exactly how cassandra-stress behaves.</p><p>For this series, I will be using the latest 3.x version of cassandra-stress. If I notice any differences related to a particular point version of Cassandra I will call them out.</p><p>In this first post, I will look at what is about the most basic cassandra-stress command you can run:<br /><code>cassandra-stress write n=10 -node x.x.x.x</code></p><p>I chose this command for two reasons: firstly, using a simple command will allow us to look at some of the basic functions that apply across any cassandra-stress command and secondly, in almost all scenarios, you will want to execute a write to populate a cluster with data before running a read or mixed scenario.</p><h2>cassandra-stress</h2><p>Let’s start by looking at that components of the command itself:</p><ul><li><code>cassandra-stress</code>: invokes a shell script which in turn invokes the main function of the Java class org.apache.cassandra.stress.Stress</li> <li><code>write</code>: execute write operations (other options being read, mixed, user, counter_write and counter_read)</li> <li><code>n=10</code>: execute 10 operations</li> <li><code>-node x.x.x.x</code>: the address of a node in the cluster to establish the initial connection</li> </ul><p>Filling in with defaults, here’s all the settings cassandra-stress will actually use for the run (from my in-progress implementation of <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-11914\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CASSANDRA-11914</a>):</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>As you can see, there is a lot going on behind the scenes. So. let’s walk-through step by step what cassandra-stress actually does when you execute this command:</p><ol><li> <ol><li>The options provided through the command line are parsed and filled in with a whole range of default options as necessary (will touch on important defaults below and more in future articles). Interestingly, at this stage a valid cassandra.yaml will need to be loaded. However, as far as I could tell this is just a side effect of cassandra-stress using some core Cassandra classes and the contents of the cassandra.yaml have no effect on the actual cassandra-stress operations.</li>\n<li>The Cassandra Java driver is used to connect to the node specified in the command line. From this node, the driver retrieves the node list and token map for the cluster and then initiates a connection to each node in the cluster.</li>\n<li>A create keyspace (if one doesn’t already exist) command is executed with the following definition:<br />While this definition is a reasonable choice for a simple default, it’s important to note that this is unlikely to be representative of a keyspace you would want to run in production. By far the most common production scenario would be to use NetworkTopologyStrategy and a replication factor of 3. To have cassandra-stress create a keyspace with this strategy you would need to drop any existing keyspace and add the following parameters to the cassandra-stress command line:<br /><code>-schema replication(strategy=NetworkTopologyStrategy,DC_NAME=3)</code><br />Replace DC_NAME with the actual name of your Cassandra data center. On some systems you may also need to escape the brackets ie. <code>replication\\(...\\)</code></li>\n<li>Once the keyspace is created, cassandra-stress creates two tables in the keyspace: standard1 and counter1. We’ll ignore counter1 for now as it’s not used in this test. The definition of the standard1 table created is as follows:<br />While, again, this is a reasonable choice for a simple default, there are a few characteristics to keep in mind if you are trying to draw conclusions from performance using this table definition:\n<ul><li>There is no clustering key, so 1 row per partition – potentially very different performance to a scenario with many rows per partition.</li>\n<li>Compression is disabled – the overhead of compression is typically not huge but could be significant.</li>\n<li>Compact Storage is enabled – this is not enabled by default and will result in smaller representation of the data on disk (although minimal difference with Cassandra 3.x).</li>\n</ul><p>I’ll cover options for using different schemas in a later installment of this series.</p></li>\n<li>cassandra-stress will attempt to make a jmx connection to the nodes in the cluster to collect garbage collection stats. If the attempt fails, the run will proceed without collection garbage collection stats.</li>\n<li>Next, cassandra-stress will run a warmup. This is a standard practice in load testing to reduce variation from start-up variation such as code being loaded to memory and JVM hotspot compilers. The number of warm-up iterations is the lesser 25% of the target of operations or 50k – 2 operations in this trivial example. The warm-up operations are basically the same as the test operations except not timed so I won’t go into them in detail.</li>\n<li>We’ve entered the actual load test phase. cassandra-stress creates 200 client threads and begins executing the target number of operations. In a real test, using the <strong>-rate</strong> option to control the number of client threads is a good way to control load on the cluster.<br />The first attempted operation will create a CQL prepared statement as follows:<br /><code>UPDATE \"standard1\" SET \"C0\" = ?,\"C1\" = ?,\"C2\" = ?,\"C3\" = ?,\"C4\" = ? WHERE KEY=?</code><br />Although we were probably expecting an INSERT statement, updates and inserts are identical in terms of Cassandra implementation so we can expect performance to be the same.This prepared statement will then be will be executed 10 times with different, random data generated for each execution. The statement will be executed with consistent level LOCAL_ONE.cassandra-stress seeds the random generation with a static string plus the column name and a seed number which for the write command defaults to sequentially used numbers from 1 to the number of operations. That means that each column will get different values but the set of values generated will be the same over multiples runs. Generating a static set of values is necessary for read tests but does have the side effect that if you were to run our sample operation (write n=10) 1000 times the end result would still be just 10 rows of data in the table.</li>\n<li>Finally, cassandra-stress prints its results. Here’s an example from a run of this command:\n<p>Many of these results are self explanatory but some bear further explanation:<br /><strong>Op rate</strong> is the rate of execution commands. <strong>Partition rate</strong> is that rate that partitions were visited (updated or read) by those commands and <strong>Row rate</strong> is that rate that rows were visited. For simple, single-row commands all three rates will be equal. The rates will vary in more complex scenarios where a single operation might visit multiple partitions and rows.<br />Similarly, <strong>Total partitions</strong> is the total number of partitions visited during the test. It’s worth noting that this is not unique partitions so even in some write-only scenarios it may not reflect the total number of partitions created by the test.<br />The <strong>GC</strong> statistics report on garbage collection and are zero in this case as JMX ports were blocked to the test cluster.</p></li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Well, that’s a lot to write about a simple test that inserts 10 rows into a table. Putting it together has helped improved my understanding of cassandra-stress, I hope it’s useful for you too. In future installments, I’ll look some more into the different data generation operations, mixed test and customers schemas using the YAML configuration file. Let me know in the comments if there are any particular areas of interest for the future articles.</p><p>Click here for <a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/blog/2016/08/23/deep-diving-into-cassandra-stress-part-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Part Two: Mixed Command</a><br />Click here for <a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/deep-diving-cassandra-stress-part-3-using-yaml-profiles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Part Three: Using YAML Profiles</a></p></div></div></div></div></div></header>",

It allows quite sophisticated specification of data and loads profiles to run against almost any table definition you can create in Cassandra. We’ve previously published detailed blog posts on the use of cassandra-stress: <a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/deep-diving-into-cassandra-stress-part-1/\">Part 1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/deep-diving-into-cassandra-stress-part-2/\">Part 2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/deep-diving-cassandra-stress-part-3-using-yaml-profiles/\">Part 3</a>.</p><p>One significant limitation of cassandra-stress has been that it is only able to execute operations against once table at a time. You could work around that by running multiple instances of cassandra-stress but that was not ideal.</p><p>I recently submitted a patch for <a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/apache-cassandra/\">Apache Cassandra</a> that now enables multiple tables to be stressed simultaneously with cassandra-stress (<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-8780\">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-8780</a>). This blog post provides some more explanation of how to use this new feature. (While the feature won’t hit release until Cassandra 4.0, it’s pretty easy to download the code and build cassandra-stress yourself if you want to use it in the meantime.)</p><p>The three core changes you need to know to stress multiple tables in one run are as follows:</p><ol><li>The profile= command line argument now accepts a comma delimited list of profile yaml files.</li> <li> Profile yaml files can now optionally contain a specname attribute which provide a way to identify the profile. If it’s not specified, the specname is inferred as &lt;keyspace&gt;.&lt;table&gt;.</li> <li>When specifying operation counts using the ops= command line argument you can prefix them with a specname to refer to an operation from a particular profile (eg spec1.insert). If you don’t specify a   specname, the specname from the first listed yaml file will be inferred.</li> </ol><p>The inferred specnames means that existing single yaml file cassandra-stress configurations will continue to run without requiring any change.</p><p>The following provides an example of how this can be used in practice:</p><p>(add all the other standard arguments you would pass to a cassandra-stress run).</p><p>Within table1.yaml, might look something like:</p><div id=\"crayon-5b9a6445f3531231561943\" class=\"crayon-syntax crayon-theme-sublime-text crayon-font-monaco crayon-os-pc print-yes notranslate\" data-settings=\"minimize scroll-mouseover\"><div class=\"crayon-main\"><table class=\"crayon-table\"><tr class=\"crayon-row\"><td class=\"crayon-nums\" data-settings=\"show\"> <div class=\"crayon-nums-content\"><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p><p>5</p><p>6</p><p>7</p><p>8</p><p>9</p><p>10</p><p>11</p><p>12</p><p>13</p><p>14</p><p>15</p><p>16</p><p>17</p><p>18</p><p>19</p><p>20</p><p>21</p><p>22</p><p>23</p><p>24</p><p>25</p><p>26</p><p>27</p><p>28</p><p>29</p><p>30</p><p>31</p><p>32</p><p>33</p><p>34</p><p>35</p></div></td>\n<td class=\"crayon-code\"><div class=\"crayon-pre\"><p># Keyspace name and create CQL</p><p>#</p><p>specname: t1</p><p>keyspace: stressexample</p><p>keyspace_definition: |</p><p>CREATE KEYSPACE stressexample WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': '1'};</p><p>#</p><p># Table name and create CQL</p><p>#</p><p>table: test1</p><p>table_definition: |</p><p>CREATE TABLE test5 (</p><p>pk int,</p><p>val text,</p><p>PRIMARY KEY (pk)</p><p>)</p><p>columnspec:</p><p>- name: pk</p><p>size: fixed(64)</p><p>population: seq(1..100000)</p><p>#</p><p># Specs for insert queries</p><p>#</p><p>insert:</p><p>partitions: fixed(1) # 1 partition per batch</p><p>batchtype: UNLOGGED # use unlogged batches</p><p>select: fixed(10)/10 # no chance of skipping a row when generating inserts</p><p>#</p><p># Read queries to run against the schema</p><p>#</p><p>queries:</p><p>single_read:</p><p>cql: select * from test1 where pk = ?</p><p>fields: samerow</p></div></td>\n</tr></table></div></div><p>table2.yaml would be similar but with specname=t2.</p><p>When you run this command cassandra-stress will first ensure that keyspaces and tables specified in each of the yaml files are created, creating them itself if necessary. It will then execute operations in the ratios specified in the ops argument – in this case, 10% inserts to table test1 as specified in table1.yaml, 10% reads using the single_read query definition and 80% inserts in the table specified in table2.yaml.</p><p>One interesting feature is that the multiple yaml files can all reference the same table in your cassandra cluster. I can see this being useful, for instance, where you want to simulate one read/write pattern against the bulk of your partitions while simultaneously simulating a different pattern against a small number of hot partitions. One thing to be aware of with this approach is that the data overlap between two different specs addressing the same table is hard to predict and so may bear close inspection if it’s important to your scenario.</p><p>I really hope this feature is useful to the Cassandra community. Let me know in the comments section (<a href=\"http://www.mail-archive.com/user@cassandra.apache.org/\">or the Cassandra user mailing list</a>) if you have any queries or suggestions.</p></div></div></div></div></div></header>",

        "content": "<p>Instaclustr recently announced coming availability of our Managed Service for <a href=\"http://www.elassandra.io/\">Elassandra</a>, which delivers Elasticsearch integrated with Apache Cassandra. This blog post drills down to explain the features and advantages of Elassandra – the best of Cassandra and ElasticSearch.</p><p>Elassandra adds the power of ElasticSearch’s fast, powerful indexing and querying to Cassandra.  By embedding Elasticsearch into Cassandra’s resilient, distributed architecture, Elassandra delivers a solution which combines the functionality of both Cassandra and Elasticsearch in a single integrated solution with improved availability features and simpler management.</p><p>Here are some of the key features:</p><ul><li><strong>Elassandra provides all the indexing and query capabilities of ElasticSearch</strong>.  This includes incredibly fast indexing, querying and analysis of structured and semistructured data.  It allows complex querying of large data sets.  Real-time indexing allows data to become searchable as soon as it is inserted into the database.</li> </ul><ul><li><strong>Powerful, flexible querying of Cassandra tables</strong>.  By design, Cassandra supports a relatively simple range of query operations, generally limited to simple primary key or range lookups.  Elassandra allows the full power of the Elasticsearch Query Language (Query DSL)  to be used to search data in Cassandra tables, including the ability to produce compound statements comprising filter and query blocks and relevance score calculations.</li> </ul><ul><li><strong>Elassandra is Cassandra</strong>.  At its core, Elassandra is the same engine as Cassandra and therefore is automatically part of the Cassandra ecosystem.  Tools and applications which work with Cassandra can be used with little or no change with Elassandra.  This means that the same familiar tools (e.g. nodetool, cqlsh) are used to manage Elassandra, and operations such as repair and compaction are done in the usual way.  Tools like Spark, Storm, Kafka and Zeppelin all work with Elassandra’s Cassandra API.</li> </ul><ul><li><strong>Elassandra is Elasticsearch</strong>.  Elassandra supports Elasticsearch’s RESTful API, and fits right into the Elassandra ecosystem.  Tools like Kibana, Logstash, Beats, JDBC driver, Spark and Kafka all work with Elassandra’s Elasticsearch API.</li> </ul><ul><li><strong>Flexible APIs</strong>.  Data can be loaded in Elassandra through Cassandra’s CQL, or via ElasticSearch’s RESTful API.  Regardless of which approach is used, Elassandra ensures that data is stored in a Cassandra table, and indexed in Elasticsearch.  A wide variety of language bindings can be used to access these APIs.  For CQL these include: Java, Python, Ruby, C#/.Net, Nodejs, PHP, C++, Closure, Scala, Clojure, Erlang, Go, Haskell &amp; Rust, and for Elasticsearch: Java, JavaScript, Groovy, .NET, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby and others many other via JSON/RESTful interface.</li> </ul><ul><li><strong>Simplified data pipeline</strong>.  A single Elassandra cluster can do the work of several components: a Cassandra cluster, an ElasticSearch cluster, and ETL processes to replicate and synchronise between clusters.  Once transactional data is loaded into an Elassandra cluster, it can be searched directly without extra pipeline steps to load from Cassandra to Elassandra.</li> </ul><ul><li><strong>Masterless Distributed Architecture</strong>.   While standalone Elasticsearch has a master node, which introduces a single point of failure which must be carefully managed.  By running Elasticsearch on Cassandra’s fully distributed, masterless distributed architecture, the single point of failure is eliminated.</li> </ul><ul><li><strong>In Elassandra, Elasticsearch indexes are managed Cassandra as secondary indexes</strong>.  Elassandra fully supports other Cassandra features including: Cluster Replication between data centres; integration with Cassandra backups; and Integration with Cassandra node add/remove functions.</li> </ul><ul><li><strong>Provisioned in minutes, fully integrated, fully managed</strong>.  With Instaclustr, you can have an Elassandra cluster provisioned in minutes, and managed and supported by Instaclustr.  Optionally, your cluster can also be automatically fully configured and integrated with Zeppelin, Spark and Kibana, allowing you to quickly build and deploy your application.</li> </ul>",

        "content": "<p>When configuring <a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/apache-cassandra/\">Apache Cassandra</a> to work in a new environment or with a new application or service we sometimes find ourselves asking <em>“What’s the difference between broadcast_address and broadcast_rpc_address again?”</em>.</p><p>The difference is <strong>broadcast_address</strong> relates to <strong>gossip</strong> and <strong>node to node</strong> <strong>communications</strong>, whereas <strong>broadcast_rpc_address</strong> is associated with <strong>client connections</strong>. Read on for more details.</p><p>The Cassandra configuration file has a few interdependent properties related to communication, which can take a bit of concentration to make sense of. Here is a (hopefully) easy to understand explanation.</p><h2>Node to node communication (i.e. gossip)</h2><p>Cassandra will bind to the <strong>listen_address</strong> or <strong>listen_interface</strong> and listen on the storage_port or ssl_storage_port for gossip. In most cases, these properties may be omitted, resulting in Cassandra binding to the hostname’s IP address (Cassandra uses <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/InetAddress.html#getLocalHost--\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">InetAddress.getLocalHost()</a>). <strong>Note:</strong> setting listen_address to “localhost” results in Cassandra binding to the loopback interface (not recommended as it only works as a 1-node cluster).</p><p><strong>broadcast_address</strong> is reported to nodes for peer discovery. Topologies that span separate networks need this set to a public address. If this property is omitted, the listen_address will be broadcast to nodes.  <strong>Note:</strong> Nodes can be configured to gossip via the local network and use public addresses for nodes outside its local network by setting <code>prefer_local=true</code> in <em>cassandra-rackdc.properties</em> and using certain endpoint_snitches (such as GossipingPropertyFileSnitch or Ec2MultiRegionSnitch).</p><h2>Client to node communication</h2><h4>rpc_address, rpc_interface and broadcast_rpc_address</h4><p>By “client” I mean Cassandra drivers and clqsh. The drivers may use the Thrift transport or the Native transport (CQL binary protocol). Cqlsh uses the Native transport.</p><p>Cassandra will bind to the <strong>rpc_address</strong> or <strong>rpc_interface</strong> and listen on rpc_port and native_transport_port for client connections. If these properties are omitted, Cassandra will bind to the hostname’s IP address (and would need to be specified to a locally running cqlsh because <code><strong>cqlsh</strong></code> = <code><strong>cqlsh</strong> <strong>&lt;loopback address&gt;</strong></code>).</p><p><strong>broadcast_rpc_address</strong> is a property available in Cassandra 2.1 and above. It is reported to clients during cluster discovery and as cluster metadata. It is useful for clients outside the cluster’s local network. This property is typically either:</p><ul><li>the public address if most clients are outside the cluster’s local network</li> <li>the local network address if most clients are in the cluster’s local network</li> </ul><p>If this property is omitted, rpc_address will be reported to clients.</p><p><strong>Note 1:</strong> If there are a mix of clients inside and outside the local network, use an AddressTranslator policy to compensate for unreachable addresses (only available for Java and Python drivers at the time of writing. <a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/apache-cassandra-deployed-on-private-and-public-networks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here is a Java example</a>.)</p><p><strong>Note 2: </strong><em>rpc_address</em> may be set to 0.0.0.0. In this case, Cassandra binds to all available interfaces, including loopback, which is used by cqlsh when no host is specified. But 0.0.0.0 is not routable, so Cassandra will use a different property to determine the address to broadcast to clients:</p><ul><li>for Cassandra 2.1 and later: broadcast_rpc_address must be set and will be reported to clients.</li> <li>for Cassandra prior to 2.1: broadcast_address (or listen_address if omitted) will be reported to clients.</li> </ul><p>Summary:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Cassandra Version</th> <th>Purpose</th> <th>Properties</th> <th>Typical Setting</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>All</td> <td>gossip</td> <td>listen_address or listen_interface (with storage_port or ssl_storage_port)</td> <td>Omit to bind to InetAddress.getLocalHost()</td> </tr><tr><td>All</td> <td>peer discovery (within the cluster)</td> <td>broadcast_address else listen_address</td> <td>public address</td> </tr><tr><td>All</td> <td>client requests (CQL and Thrift)</td> <td>rpc_address or rpc_interface (with rpc_port and native_transport_port)</td> <td>Omit to bind to InetAddress.getLocalHost()</td> </tr><tr><td>2.1 and later</td> <td>cluster discovery | metadata (to the client)</td> <td>broadcast_rpc_address else rpc_address</td> <td>Omit to broadcast InetAddress.getLocalHost()</td> </tr><tr><td>2.0 and prior</td> <td>cluster discovery | metadata (to the client)</td> <td>rpc_address or broadcast_address if 0.0.0.0</td> <td>Omit to broadcast InetAddress.getLocalHost()</td> </tr></tbody></table>",

Is it safe?!</h2><p>Maybe a cautious approach to a bigger version of the Monolith (2km long) in a POD that is only 2m in diameter is advisable.   What do we know about how Monoliths react to stimuli? A simple classification problem consists of the category (label) “no reaction” (0) or “reaction” (1), and the stimuli tried (features which will be used to predict the label).  In the following table, the first column in the label to be predicted (positive, 1, or negative, 0), the remaining columns are the features, and each row is an example:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Classification-problem-table-instaclustr.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6886 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Classification-problem-table-instaclustr-300x292.png\" alt=\"classification problem table Instaclustr\" width=\"300\" height=\"292\" srcset=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Classification-problem-table-instaclustr-300x292.png 300w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Classification-problem-table-instaclustr-768x747.png 768w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Classification-problem-table-instaclustr-1024x996.png 1024w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Classification-problem-table-instaclustr-633x616.png 633w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Classification-problem-table-instaclustr-640x622.png 640w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Classification-problem-table-instaclustr-49x48.png 49w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Classification-problem-table-instaclustr-111x108.png 111w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Classification-problem-table-instaclustr.png 1088w\" /></a></p><p>This problem is trivial as a positive reaction only occurred for Touch OR Sunlight (the camera flash was a co-incidence), the features are all binary, and only a single feature at a time is true. As a result of extensive tests on the Monolith imagine that there are lots more examples and data available, each feature is a floating point number, all features don’t have values for all examples, there are potentially 1,000s of features, and a sufficiently accurate classification rule may require an arbitrary number of features.</p><p>Given that HAL has been unplugged we have to analyse the data ourselves. What do we have available in the POD?</p><p>One approach is to use an appropriately 1960’s-vintage machine learning algorithm suitable for simple binary classification problems. Decision tree algorithms were invented in the 1960’s (Concept Learning System, by a Psychologist, Earl Hunt), were improved in the 1980’s (e.g. ID3, C4.5, and <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023%2FA%3A1022699322624.pdf\">FOIL</a>, which references my 1988 machine learning algorithm, <i>Gargantubrain</i>), and are still useful. Spark’s Machine Learning Library (MLLib) has a number of regression and classification algorithms, including decision trees, that improve on the originals by running them “transparently” in parallel on multiple servers for scalability. </p><p><a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/mllib/\">Spark’s scalable ML library is available here</a>. It’s easy to download Spark and run MLLib examples locally, but the scalability benefits are best realised after deployment to an <a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/solutions/managed-apache-spark/\">Instaclustr managed Spark cluster.</a> Here’s the documentation on the <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-decision-tree.html\">MLLib decision tree</a> algorithm.</p><h2>Training</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/download-1.jpeg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6888 size-full\" src=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/download-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Training Instaclustr\" width=\"198\" height=\"254\" srcset=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/download-1.jpeg 198w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/download-1-37x48.jpeg 37w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/download-1-84x108.jpeg 84w\" /></a></p><p>We’ll have a look at the example Java code, starting from the call to the decision tree algorithm to build the model from the examples, and working out from there. <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/org/apache/spark/mllib/tree/DecisionTree.html\">DecisionTree</a> and <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/org/apache/spark/mllib/tree/model/DecisionTreeModel.html\">DecisionTreeModel</a> documents are relevant.  Here’s the code.  Note the API for trainClassifier:</p><p>trainClassifier(JavaRDD&lt;LabeledPoint&gt; input, int numClasses,<br />java.util.Map&lt;Integer,Integer&gt; categoricalFeaturesInfo, String<br />impurity, int maxDepth, int maxBins)</p><p>The first argument is a JavaRDD of LabeledPoint.

JavaRDD.randomSplit() does this and takes parameters:</p><p>double[] weights – weights for splits, will be normalized if they don’t sum to 1</p><p>long seed – random seed</p><p>// Split sample RDD into two sets, 60% training data, 40% testing data. 11 is a seed.</p><p>   JavaRDD&lt;LabeledPoint&gt;[] splits = data.randomSplit(new double[]{0.6, 0.4}, 11L);</p><p>   JavaRDD&lt;LabeledPoint&gt; trainingData = splits[0].cache();  // cache the data</p><p>   JavaRDD&lt;LabeledPoint&gt; testData = splits[1];</p><p>Notice the cache() call for trainingData.  What does it do? Spark is Lazy, it doesn’t evaluate RDD’s until an action forces it to. Hence RDD’s can be evaluated multiple times which is expensive. cache() creates an in memory cache “checkpoint” of an RDD which can be reused. The most obvious case is when an RDD is used multiple times (i.e. iteration), or for branching transformations (i.e. multiple different RDD’s are computed from an original RDD), in which case the original should be cached.<br /><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28981359/why-do-we-need-to-call-cache-or-persist-on-a-rdd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28981359/why-do-we-need-to-call-cache-or-persist-on-a-rdd</a><br /></p><p>Note that for this example the <i>initial data </i>should be cached as we use it later to count the total, positive and negative examples.</p><h2>Evaluating the Model on the Test Data – Thumbs down or up?</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Evaluating-the-model-on-the-test-Data-2-Instaclustr.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6892 size-medium_large\" src=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Evaluating-the-model-on-the-test-Data-2-Instaclustr-768x521.png\" alt=\"Evaluating the model on the test data Instaclustr\" width=\"768\" height=\"521\" srcset=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Evaluating-the-model-on-the-test-Data-2-Instaclustr-768x521.png 768w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Evaluating-the-model-on-the-test-Data-2-Instaclustr-300x204.png 300w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Evaluating-the-model-on-the-test-Data-2-Instaclustr-1024x695.png 1024w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Evaluating-the-model-on-the-test-Data-2-Instaclustr-907x616.png 907w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Evaluating-the-model-on-the-test-Data-2-Instaclustr-640x434.png 640w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Evaluating-the-model-on-the-test-Data-2-Instaclustr-71x48.png 71w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Evaluating-the-model-on-the-test-Data-2-Instaclustr-159x108.png 159w\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Evaluating-the-model-on-the-test-data-1-Instaclustr.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6893 size-medium_large\" src=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Evaluating-the-model-on-the-test-data-1-Instaclustr-768x394.png\" alt=\"Evaluating the model on the test data Instaclustr\" width=\"768\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Evaluating-the-model-on-the-test-data-1-Instaclustr-768x394.png 768w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Evaluating-the-model-on-the-test-data-1-Instaclustr-300x154.png 300w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Evaluating-the-model-on-the-test-data-1-Instaclustr-1024x525.png 1024w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Evaluating-the-model-on-the-test-data-1-Instaclustr-966x496.png 966w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Evaluating-the-model-on-the-test-data-1-Instaclustr-640x328.png 640w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Evaluating-the-model-on-the-test-data-1-Instaclustr-94x48.png 94w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Evaluating-the-model-on-the-test-data-1-Instaclustr-210x108.png 210w\" /></a></p><p>We trained a decision tree model above.

Transformations pass each dataset element through a function and return a new RDD representing the result. Actions return a result after running a computation on a dataset. Transformations are lazy and are not computed until required by an action. In the above example, for every example in testData, p, it is replaced by a Tuple of (predicted category, labelled category). These values are computed by running model.predict() on all the features in the example, and using the label() of the example.</p><p>See LabeledPoint <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/org/apache/spark/mllib/regression/LabeledPoint.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">documentation</a> for features() and label() methods.</p><p><a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/index.html?org/apache/spark/api/java/JavaPairRDD.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JavaPairRDD</a> is a (key, value) version of RDD. Instead of the general map function you need to use mapToPair.</p><p><i>Map</i> (and <i>mapToPair</i>) are examples of “Higher Order Functions”. These are used a lot in Spark but are really pretty ancient and were first practically used in 1960 in <a href=\"http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LISP</a>. Disturbingly the abstract sounds like an early attempt at HAL:</p><p><i>“A programming system called LISP … was designed to facilitate experiments … whereby a machine could be instructed to … exhibit “common sense” in carrying out its instructions.”</i></p><p>I used LISP for a real AI project (once), but (it ((had too) (many) brackets) (for (((me (Lots of Idiotic Spurious Parentheses))) ???!!! (are these balanced?!).</p><p>preferred(I, Prolog).</p><p>The following code prints out the main evaluation metrics, precision, recall and F.</p><p>JavaRDD&lt;Tuple2&lt;Object, Object&gt;&gt; precision = metrics.precisionByThreshold().toJavaRDD();</p><p>   System.out.println(“Precision by threshold: ” + precision.collect());</p><p>   JavaRDD&lt;Tuple2&lt;Object, Object&gt;&gt; recall = metrics.recallByThreshold().toJavaRDD();</p><p>   System.out.println(“Recall by threshold: ” + recall.collect());</p><p>   JavaRDD&lt;Tuple2&lt;Object, Object&gt;&gt; f = metrics.fMeasureByThreshold().toJavaRDD();</p><p>   System.out.println(“F by threshold: ” + f.collect());</p><p>Note that the metrics are designed for algorithms that can have multiple threshold values (i.e. the classification can have an associated probability).  However, the decision tree algorithm we are using is a simple yes/no binary classification.  A “confusion matrix” is a simple way of understanding the evaluation metrics. For each of the two states of reality (no reaction or reaction from the monolith) the model can make a true or false prediction giving four possible outcomes: Correct: TN = True Negative (the model correctly predicted no reaction), TP = True Positive (correctly predicted a reaction). And Incorrect: FP = False Positive (predicted a reaction but there was no reaction), FN = False Negative (predicted no reaction but there was a reaction).  FP is often called a Type I error, and FN a type II error. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Model-prediction-Instaclustr.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6895 size-large\" src=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Model-prediction-Instaclustr-1024x382.png\" alt=\"Model Prediction Instaclustr\" width=\"1024\" height=\"382\" srcset=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Model-prediction-Instaclustr-1024x382.png 1024w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Model-prediction-Instaclustr-300x112.png 300w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Model-prediction-Instaclustr-768x287.png 768w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Model-prediction-Instaclustr-966x360.png 966w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Model-prediction-Instaclustr-640x239.png 640w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Model-prediction-Instaclustr-129x48.png 129w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Model-prediction-Instaclustr-290x108.png 290w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Model-prediction-Instaclustr.png 1544w\" /></a></p><p><b>Precision</b> = (TP)/(TP+FP), the proportion of <i>predicted</i> <i>positives</i> that were actually positive (the right column).</p><p><b>Recall = </b>(TP)/(TP+FN), the proportion of <i>actual</i> <i>positives</i> that were correctly predicted as positive (the bottom row). </p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">F is the average of precision and recall.</a></p><p>And the results (on the extended When Will the Monolith React? data) were as follows:</p><p>Precision = 71%</p><p>Recall = 45%</p><p>F = 56%</p><p>Precision is better than recall. 71% of the models predicted “Reaction” cases were in fact a “Reaction”.

To do this we don’t need access to all the metrics per host, just a subset. And we can extend it in the future to use multiple variables and/or regression classification to predict which GCs are likely to be “long”.</em></p><p>Let’s look at some sample heap space data and GC time information. Here’s a graph showing heap space used increasing over time (x-axis, seconds) and then a GC kicking in (orange line), resulting in a reduction in the heap space used. The GC value is the duration of the last GC so changes from approximately 7s to 9s.</p><p><a href=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/15-min-sample-heap-and-lastGC-duration.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6852 size-large\" src=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/15-min-sample-heap-and-lastGC-duration-1024x529.png\" alt=\"15 min sample heap and lastGC duration\" width=\"1024\" height=\"529\" srcset=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/15-min-sample-heap-and-lastGC-duration-1024x529.png 1024w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/15-min-sample-heap-and-lastGC-duration-300x155.png 300w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/15-min-sample-heap-and-lastGC-duration-768x397.png 768w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/15-min-sample-heap-and-lastGC-duration-966x499.png 966w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/15-min-sample-heap-and-lastGC-duration-640x331.png 640w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/15-min-sample-heap-and-lastGC-duration-93x48.png 93w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/15-min-sample-heap-and-lastGC-duration-209x108.png 209w\" /></a></p><p>The following graph shows a linear regression function fitted to the portion of the heap space used graph in the interval between GCs.

Assuming we know (or can compute) the amount of heap used that triggers a GC then yes. This may be node-specific (depending on how much heap is available), may change (as more memory is allocated), and may be a percentage (which we have to compute, for this example it was 70%). Obviously, the slope of the function will vary across and even within nodes depending on the frequency of GC (which may depend on many other variables which we’ll look at next time), so the function needs to be computed for each node for each interval between GCs. This requires us to do a few things: Find when each GC occurs so we can determine the time period from the end of the last GC to the start of the next GC to use as the sample period to compute the regression function over; for each interval normalise the actual timestamps to relative time (in seconds) from the start of the interval; keep track of the amount of heap used that triggers the GC (or compute the percentage used); and find sufficient samples for a node to make predictions and check the accuracy and usefulness of the results.</p><p>Some preliminary inspection of sample data showed a few problems. Using GC startTime and endTime seemed to be the obvious way of finding when GCs occurred. However, there was something odd about the times as they were in the distant past, in fact, they were about 300 times less than expected. Oh, that five minutes isn’t it. Turns out that they had been truncated to bucket_time making them useless for my purpose. Another thing to watch for with Cassandra timestamps is that they are in UTC. If you convert them to a Java Date type they will be in local time. The <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Instant.html\">Java Instant class</a> is a better representation once you read the timestamps on the client side (Instant is UTC, and has lots of useful time comparison methods).</p><p>Is there a way of using either GC duration and/or collectionCount to compute the GC start/end times? Yes, in theory. Both approaches worked ok, but I noticed large gaps in the timestamps for most nodes which made using duration tricky. The final version used collectionCount and discarded GC events that were more than 1 count different.   But why were there gaps in the data?</p><h2>Materialization accidents – “beam me down Scotty!”</h2><p>My suspicion turned to the materialized views (MVs) I had to created to make the queries easier. Obviously, MVs take time to populate from an existing table, but how do you know if they are complete? There are two system tables to check, one shows build in progress, and one shows built views completed  (system.built_views): </p><h6>keyspace_name | view_name              | generation_number | last_token<br />———————-+————————-+—————————-+—————————–<br />instametrics       | host_service_time  |             16563                 | -9178511905308517795<br />instametrics       | host_service_value |             16563                | -9178511746231999096</h6><p>So this probably explained the data gaps – a few days after creation the MVs were still being built. In fact I suspect they have got “stuck” (anyone know how to unstick them? I tried dropping a MV and trying to create another but this resulted in other nasty things). Given its sci-fi origins, I should have been wary of <a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/apache-cassandra/\">Cassandra</a> Materialization!

However, it was only finding a relatively small number of GCs per node due to the data gaps. I realized that the default read consistency level is only one, which means that only data from the first node it is found on is returned. I tried increasing the consistency level (to QUORUM) which resulted in more GCs found. See code on GIST:</p><p>Each regression analysis uses only the first half of the available data, and if the R-squared value is over 0.5 then the computed function is used to predict the next GC time, and the percentage error is computed and averaged over all results founds and reported as follows:</p><p><strong>Total time = 428,469ms</strong></p><p><strong>avgPerErr = 21.59 gcAvgInterval = 13,447.88s used 42.0 out of 218.0</strong></p><p>The analysis took 428 seconds, for the regressions that had a sufficiently high correlation (about 20%), the average percentage prediction error for the time of the next GC was 22%. The average time between GCs was 13,447 seconds, so the average error is about 3,000 seconds. So this approach would work well, but for only 20% of cases. There’s obviously something more complicated going on for the majority of cases requiring us to get even closer to the monolith, we need to install the analysis code closer to the data. </p><aside class=\"content-cta\"><div class=\"primary\"><h4>Related Articles:</h4></div></aside>",

Warp drive offline. We’re running on auxiliary impulse engines to Jupiter to explore an anomaly. Our mission is to explore a snapshot of the Instametrics monitoring data on a Cassandra cluster that has appeared around the orbit of Jupiter. Our goal is to predict long JVM garbage collection durations at least five minutes in advance. Initiating long-range sensor scans after which I will attempt a risky long-range transportation down to the surface of the anomaly.”</em></p><p>Let’s get <a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/apache-cassandra/\">Cassandra</a> to do all the hard work to reduce the amount of data we need to transfer from the cluster to my laptop. There are two approaches that may result in some useful insights. Calculating some summary statistics, and creating a materialized view.</p><p>The first challenge is connecting to the Cassandra cluster. Unlike the trial cluster example I used previously, this cluster had been created with private IP broadcast_rpc_adresses rather than public IP addresses. Does this mean I can’t connect to the cluster from outside the private address range at all? Not exactly. You can still connect via a single public IP address, which will then become the only controller node your client communicates with. For testing, this is probably ok, but there is a <a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/apache-cassandra-deployed-on-private-and-public-networks/\">better solution</a> using VPC peering and the private IP addresses.</p><p>The next step is to see what JVM GC related metrics were collected. </p><p>Connecting via the cqlshell, we can run some CQL commands. </p><p>Describe instametrics;</p><p>Reveals that there are some meta-data tables which contain all the host names, and all the metric (“service”) names for each host:</p><p>How many nodes are there in this sample data set? </p><p>cqlsh&gt; select count(host) from instametrics.host;</p><p><b>system.count(host)<br /></b>————————–<br /><b>                               591</b></p><p>The next question I had was how many metrics are there per node? Using a sample of the host names found in the host table I ran this query a few times:</p><p>select count(service) from instametrics.service_per_host where host=’random host name’;</p><p>The somewhat surprising answer was between 1 and lots (16122!). About 1000 seemed an average so this means about 591*1000 metrics in total = 591,000. </p><p>From this distance, we therefore need to focus on just a few metrics. Selecting all the metrics available for one host we find that the following are the only metrics directly related to JVM GC.</p><p><b>collectionCount</b> is the count of the GC, and <b>collectionTime</b> is the total GC collection time, since last JVM restart.</p><h6><strong>/cassandra/jvm/gc/ConcurrentMarkSweep/collectionCount                                                                               </strong></h6><h6><strong>/cassandra/jvm/gc/ConcurrentMarkSweep/collectionTime</strong></h6><p><b>duration</b> is the time of the last occurring GC, and <b>startTime</b> and <b>endTime</b> are the time of the start and end of the last occurring GC.</p><h6><strong>/cassandra/jvm/gc/ConcurrentMarkSweep/lastGc/duration</strong></h6><h6><strong>/cassandra/jvm/gc/ConcurrentMarkSweep/lastGc/endTime</strong></h6><h6><strong>/</strong>cassandra<strong>/</strong>jvm<strong>/</strong>gc<strong>/ConcurrentMarkSweep/</strong>lastGc<strong>/</strong>startTime</h6><p>I normally start a data analysis by looking at statistics for some of the metrics of interest, such as distribution (e.g. a CDF graph) or a histogram.  But to compute these statistics you need access to all the data…</p><p>Kirk: “Mister Spock. Full sensor scan of the anomaly, please.”</p><p>Spock:  “Captain,  the results are not logical – I’m picking up what looks like Buckets – Fascinating!”</p><p>Buckets can be problematic:</p><ul><li>A drop in the bucket</li>\n<li>To kick the bucket</li>\n<li>There’s a hole in my bucket</li>\n</ul><p>The table with the actual values for the hosts and services is defined as follows:</p><p>The partition key requires values for <b>host, bucket_time </b>and<b> service</b> to select a subset of rows.   What’s bucket_time? Based on the name of the table and inspecting a sample of the rows, it’s the timestamp truncated to 5 minute bucket periods. How do we find the range of bucket_time values for the table? Here’s a few ways… You just “know it” (but I don’t).  The range has been recorded in another table (not that I can see). Or, start from now and search backwards in time by 5 minute intervals. This assumes that the data is really from the past and not the future. Start from the Epoch and search forward? Do a binary search between the Epoch and now? Look at samples of the data? This revealed that at least some of the data was from the early part of 2016. This would give us a starting point to search forwards and backwards in time until gaps are detected when we can assume they are the temporal boundaries of the data (assuming there aren’t large gaps in the data).</p><p>An alternative approach is to make a copy of the table with bucket_time removed from the partition key. Is this possible? Well, yes, in theory. <a href=\"http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cql/mvs.html\">Materialized VIews </a>are possible in Cassandra, and can even be created from existing tables. I created two materialized views, one with the values ordered (descending), and one with the time ordered (ascending).</p><p>Note that the rules for Materialized Views are very specific. You have to include all the columns from the original PRIMARY KEY in the new table (but they can be in the partition or cluster keys and in different orders), you can include at most one extra column in the new primary key, and the select has to be present and include at least one column – even though the partition key columns are selected by default). The idea was to use the first materialized view to get some summary statistics of the GC durations (e.g. min, average, max), and the second for queries over specific time periods and metrics (to find GCs, and heap memory used between GCs).</p><p>This worked as expected, taking 172 seconds, with these results:</p><p>Total time = 172343, nodes = 591</p><p>Overall stats: Min = 47.0</p><p>Overall stats: Avg = 6555.39</p><p>Overall stats: Max = 56095.0</p><p>The maximum GC duration was 56s, with an “average” of 6.5s.</p><p>Here’s the partial code I used:</p><p>On closer inspection, the average values were incorrect, as the GC duration values are repeated for multiple timestamps.  However, I also obtained the max GC duration for each node, revealing that about 200 nodes (out of 591) had maximum GC durations greater than 10s. This is a good start for “remote” data analysis.</p><aside class=\"content-cta\"><div class=\"primary\"><h4>Related Articles:</h4></div></aside>",

This post was very popular and led me to think about what advice we could provide on<br />how to approach designing your Cassandra data model so as to come up with a quality design that<br />avoids the traps.</p><p>There are a number of good articles around that with rules and patterns to fit your data model into:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/resource/6-step-guide-to-apache-cassandra-data-modelling-white-paper/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">6 Step Guide to Apache Cassandra Data Modelling </a></p><p>and</p><p><a href=\"https://support.instaclustr.com/hc/en-us/articles/207071957-Data-Modelling-Recommended-Practices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Data Modelling Recommended Practices</a></p><p>However, we haven’t found a step by step guide to analysing your data to determine how to fit in<br />these rules and patterns. This white paper is a quick attempt at filling that gap.</p><h2>Phase 1: Understand the data</h2><p>This phase has two distinct steps that are both designed to gain a good understanding of the data that<br />you are modelling and the access patterns required.</p><h3>Define the data domain</h3><p>The first step is to get a good understanding of your data domain. As someone very familiar with<br />relation data modelling, I tend to sketch (or at least think) ER diagrams to understand the entities,<br />their keys and relationships. However, if you’re familiar with another notation then it would likely<br />work just as well. The key things you need to understand at a logical level are:</p><p>• What are the entities (or objects) in your data model?<br />• What are the primary key attributes of the entities?<br />• What are the relationships between the entities (i.e. references from one to the other)?<br />• What is the relative cardinality of the relationships (i.e. if you have a one to many is it one to<br />10 or one to 10,000 on average)?</p><p>Basically, these are the same things you’d expect in from logical ER model (although we probably<br />don’t need a complete picture of all the attributes) along with a complete understanding of the<br />cardinality of relationships that you’d normally need for a relational model.<br />An understanding of the demographics of key attributes (cardinality, distribution) will also be useful<br />in finalising your Cassandra model. Also, understand which key attributes are fixed and which change<br />over the life of a record.</p><h3>Define the required access patterns</h3><p>The next step, or quite likely a step carried out in conjunction with step 1, is to understand how you<br />will need to access your data:</p><ul><li>List out the paths you will follow to access the data, such as: <ul><li>Start with a customer id, search for transactions in a date range and then look up all the<br />details about a particular transaction from the search resultsStart with a particular server and metric, retrieve x metrics values in ascending age</li> <li>Start with a particular server and metric, retrieve x metrics values in ascending age starting at a particular point in time.</li> <li>For a given sensor, retrieve all readings of multiple metrics for a given day.</li> <li>For a given sensor, retrieve the current value.</li> </ul></li> </ul><ul><li>Remember that any updates of a record are an access path that needs to be considered</li> <li>Determine which accesses are the most crucial from a performance point of view – are there some which need to be as quick as possible while performance requirements for others allow time for multiple reads or range scans?</li> <li>Remember that you need a pretty complete understanding of how you will access your data at this stage – part of the trade-off for Cassandra’s performance, reliability and scalability is a fairly restricted set of methods for accessing data in a particular table.</li> </ul><h2>Phase 2: Understand the entities</h2><p>This phase has two specific steps designed to gain an understanding of both the primary and<br />secondary entities associated with the data.</p><h3>Identify primary access entities</h3><p>Now we’re moving from analysing your data domain and application requirements to starting to<br />design your data model. You really want to be pretty solid on steps 1 and 2 before moving on to this<br />stage.</p><p>The idea here is to denormalize your data into the smallest number of tables possible based on your<br />access patterns. For each lookup by key that your access patterns require, you will need a table to<br />satisfy that lookup. I’ve coined the term primary access entity to describe the entity your using for<br />the lookup (for example, a lookup by client id is using client as the primary access entity, a lookup by<br />server and metric name is using a server-metric entity as the primary access entity).</p><p>The primary access entity defines the partition level (or grain if you’re familiar with dimensional<br />modelling) of the resulting denormalized table (i.e. there will be one partition in the table for each<br />instance of the primary access entity).</p><p>You may choose to satisfy some access patterns using secondary indexes rather than complete replicas<br />of the data with a different primary access entity. Keep in mind that columns in include in a secondary<br />index should have a significantly lower cardinality than the table being indexed and be aware of the<br />frequency of updates of the indexed value.</p><p>For the example access patterns above, we would define the following primary access entities:</p><ul><li>customer and transaction (get a list of transactions from the customer entity and then use that<br />to look up transaction details from the transaction entity)</li> <li>server-metric</li> <li>sensor</li> <li>sensor</li> </ul><h3>Allocate secondary entities</h3><p>The next step is to find a place to store the data that belongs to entities that have not been chosen as<br />primary access entities (I’ll call these entities secondary entities). You can choose to:</p><ul><li><strong> Push down</strong> by taking data from a parent secondary entity (one side) of a one to many<br />relationship and storing multiple copies of it at the primary access entity level (for example,<br />storing customer phone number in each customer order record); or</li> <li><strong>Push up</strong> by taking data from the child secondary entity (many side) of a one to many<br />relationship and storing it at the primary access entity level either by use of cluster keys or by<br />use of multi-value types (list and maps) (for example adding a list of line items to a transaction<br />level table).</li> </ul><p>For some secondary entities, there will only be one related primary access entity and so there is no<br />need to choose where and which direction to push. For other entities, you will need to choose will<br />need to choose which primary access entities to push the data into.</p><p>For optimal read performance, you should push a copy of the data to every primary access entity that<br />is used as an access path for the data in the secondary entity.</p><p>However, this comes at an insert/update performance and application complexity cost of maintaining<br />multiple copies the data. This trade-off between read performance and data maintenance cost needs<br />to be judged in the context of the specific performance requirements of your application.</p><p>The other decision to be made at this stage is between using a cluster key or a multi-value type for<br />pushing up. In general:</p><ul><li>Use a clustering key where there is only one child secondary entity to push up and particularly<br />where the child secondary entity itself has children to roll-up.</li> <li>Use multi-value types where there are multiple child entities to push up into the primary entity</li> </ul><p>Note that these rules are probably oversimplified but serve as a starting point for more detailed<br />consideration.</p><h2>Phase 3: Review &amp; Tune</h2><p>The last phase provides an opportunity to review the data model, test and to tune as necessary.</p><h3>Review partition &amp; cluster keys</h3><p>Entering this stage, you have all the data you need to store allocated to a table or tables and your<br />tables support accessing that data according to your required access patterns. The next step is to<br />check that the resulting data model makes efficient use of Cassandra and, if not, to adjust. The items<br />to check and adjust at this stage are:</p><ul><li><strong>Do your partition keys have sufficient cardinality?</strong> If not, it may be necessary to move<br />columns from the clustering key to the partition key (e.g. changing primary key (client_id,<br />timestamp) to primary key ((client_id, timestamp))) or introduce new columns which group<br />multiple cluster keys into partitions (e.g. changing primary key (client_id, timestamp) to<br />primary key ((client_id, day), timestamp).</li> <li><strong>Will the values in your partition keys be updated frequently?</strong> Updates of a primary key<br />value will result in deletion and re-insertion of the record which can result in issues with<br />tombstones. For example, trying to maintain a table with all clients of a particular status, you<br />might have primary key (status, client ID). However, this will result in a delete and re-insert<br />every time a client’s status changes. This would be a good candidate to use a set or list data<br />type rather than including client ID as the cluster key.</li> <li><strong>Is the number of records in each partition bounded?</strong> Extremely large partitions and/or very<br />unevenly sized partitions can cause issues. For example, if you have a client_updates table<br />with primary key (client_id, update_timestamp) there is potentially no limit to how many times<br />a particular client record can be update and you may have significant unevenness if you have a<br />small number of clients that have been around for 10 years and most clients only having<br />a day or two’s history. This is another example where it’s useful to introduce new columns<br />which group multiple cluster keys into partitions partitions (e.g. changing primary key (client_<br />id, update_timestamp) to primary key ((client_id, month), update_timestamp).</li> </ul><h3>Test and tune</h3><p>The final step is perhaps the most important – test your data model and tune it as required. Keep in<br />mind that issues like partitions or rows growing too large or tombstones building up in a table may<br />only become visible after days (or longer) of use under real-world load. It’s therefore important to test<br />as closely as possible to real-world load and to monitor closely for any warning signs (the nodetool<br />cfstats and cfhistograms commands are very useful for this).</p><p>At this stage you may also consider tuning some of the settings that effect the physical storage of your<br />data. For example:</p><ul><li>changing compaction strategy;</li> <li>reducing gc_grace_seconds if you are only deleting data using TTL; <strong>or</strong></li> <li>setting caching options.</li> </ul><h2>A Worked Example</h2><p>To illustrate this, I’ll walk through a basic example based on building a database to store and retrieve<br />log messages from multiple servers. Note this is quite simplified compared to most real-world<br />requirements.</p><h3>Step 1: Define the data domain</h3><p><a href=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Defining-the-data-domain-Instaclustr-Data-model-Design.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6928 size-large\" src=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Defining-the-data-domain-Instaclustr-Data-model-Design-1024x616.png\" alt=\"Defining the data model domain Instaclustr Data Model design\" width=\"1024\" height=\"616\" srcset=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Defining-the-data-domain-Instaclustr-Data-model-Design-1024x616.png 1024w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Defining-the-data-domain-Instaclustr-Data-model-Design-300x180.png 300w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Defining-the-data-domain-Instaclustr-Data-model-Design-768x462.png 768w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Defining-the-data-domain-Instaclustr-Data-model-Design-966x581.png 966w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Defining-the-data-domain-Instaclustr-Data-model-Design-640x385.png 640w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Defining-the-data-domain-Instaclustr-Data-model-Design-80x48.png 80w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Defining-the-data-domain-Instaclustr-Data-model-Design-180x108.png 180w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Defining-the-data-domain-Instaclustr-Data-model-Design.png 1576w\" /></a></p><p>The previous ER diagram illustrated the data domain. We have:</p><ul><li>Lots (millions) of log messages which have a timestamp and a body. Although message ID is<br />shown as the primary key in the ER diagram, message time plus message type is an alternate<br />primary key.</li> <li>Each log message has a message type and types are further grouped into a message category<br />(for example, a message type might be “out of memory error” and category might be “error”).<br />There a couple of hundred message types and around 20 categories.</li> <li>Each log message comes from a message source. The message source is the server that<br />generated the message. There are 1000s of servers in our system. Each message source has a<br />source type to categorise the source (e.g. red hat server, ubuntu server, windows server,<br />router, etc.). There are around 20 source types. There are ~10,000 messages per source per<br />day.</li> <li>The message body can be parsed and stored as multiple message parts (basically key, value<br />pairs). There is typically less than 20 parts per message.</li> </ul><h3>Step 2: Define the required access patterns</h3><p>We need to be able to:</p><ul><li>Retrieve all available information about the most recent 10 messages for a given source (and<br />be able to work back in time from there).</li> <li>Retrieve all available information about the most recent 10 message for a given source type.</li> </ul><h3>Step 3: Identify primary access entities</h3><p>There are two primary access entities here – source and source type. The cardinality (~20) of source<br />type makes it a good candidate for a secondary index so we will use source as the primary access<br />entity and add a secondary index for source type.</p><h3>Step 4: Allocate secondary entities</h3><p>In this example, this step is relatively simple as all data needs to roll into the log source primary access<br />entity. So we:</p><ul><li>Push down source type name</li> <li>Push down message category and message type to log message</li> <li>Push up log message as the clustering key for the new entity</li> <li>Push up message part as a map type with.</li> </ul><p>The end result is that would be a single table with a partition key of source ID and a clustering key of<br />(message time, message type).</p><h3>Step 5: Review partition and cluster keys</h3><p>Checking these partition and cluster keys against the checklist:</p><ul><li>Do your partition keys have sufficient cardinality? Yes, there are 1000s of sources.</li> <li>Will the values in your partition keys being updated frequently? No, all the data is write-once.</li> <li>Is the number of records in each partition bounded? No – messages could build up indefinitely over time.</li> </ul><p>So, we need to address the unbound partition size. A typical pattern to address that in time series<br />data such as this is to introduce a grouping of time periods into the cluster key. In this case 10,000<br />messages per day is a reasonable number to include in one partition so we’ll use day as part of our<br />partition key.</p><p>The resulting Cassandra table will look some like:</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully, this process and basic example will help you start to get familiar with Cassandra data<br />modelling. We’ve only covered a basic implementation that fits well with Cassandra, however there<br />are many other examples on the web which can help you work through more complex requirements.<br />Instaclustr also provides our customers with data modelling review and assistance, so get in touch<br />with us if you need some hands-on assistance.</p>",

        "title": "Apache Cassandra Scalability: Allow Filtering and Partition Keys - Instaclustr",
        "url": "https://www.instaclustr.com/apache-cassandra-scalability-allow-filtering-partition-keys/",
        "content": "<p>The ‘ALLOW FILTERING’ clause in <a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/apache-cassandra/\">Cassandra</a>  CQL provides greatly increased flexibility of querying. However, this flexibility comes at a substantial performance cost that should be aware of before using ‘ALLOW FILTERING’.  This post explains the costs and benefits of ALLOW FILTERING.</p><p>The data storage and query operations in Cassandra work on top of partitioned data which is similar to most of other Big Data management systems. As most people would be familiar with from relational databases, each table definition has a primary key defined which can be a single attribute or combination of 2 or more. One or more attributes from the primary key are used to specify the ‘partition key’ for the table.</p><p>Example:</p><p>Here, the primary key is composed of (machine, cpu,mtime) out of which (machine, cpu) are used as partition key and (mtime) is used as clustering key.</p><p>The purpose of a partition key is to split the data into partitions where an entire partition is stored on a single node in the cluster (with each node storing many partitions). When data is read or written from the cluster, a function called <i>Partitioner</i> is used to compute the hash value of the partition key. This hash value is used to determine the node/partition which contains that row. The clustering key is used further to search for a row within a given partition. </p><p>Select queries in Apache Cassandra look a lot like select queries from a relational database. However, they are significantly more restricted. The attributes allowed in ‘where’ clause of Cassandra query must include the full partition key and additional clauses may only reference the clustering key columns or a secondary index of the table being queried. </p><p>Requiring the partition key attributes in the ‘where’ helps Cassandra to maintain constant result-set retrieval time as the cluster is scaled-out by allowing Cassandra to determine the partition, and thus the node (and even data files on disk), that the query must be directed to. </p><p>If a query does not specify the values for all the columns from the primary key  in the ‘where’ clause, Cassandra will not execute it and give the following warning :</p><p>‘<i>InvalidRequest: Error from server: code=2200 [Invalid query] message=”Cannot execute this query as it might involve data filtering and thus may have unpredictable performance. If you want to execute this query despite the performance unpredictability, use ALLOW FILTERING</i>” ‘</p><p>You can use execute queries that use a secondary index without ALLOW FILTERING – more on that later.</p><p>The reason behind this warning is that when the complete partition key is not included in the WHERE clause, there is no way for Cassandra to identify the node which contains the required results, and thus it will need to scan the complete dataset on each node to ensure it has found the required data. Hence, the query execution time is not proportional to the size of the result returned but rather to the total amount of data stored in the referenced table. One implication of this, other than initial poor performance, is that query performance is likely to get worse as your cluster scales (unlike partition key queries which exhibit constant response times while scaling)  </p><p>As I mentioned early, you can also execute queries that reference a secondary index without specifying a partition key value or using ALLOW FILTERING.</p><p>Let’s take an example to understand this:</p><p>Consider the following table holding user profiles with their year of birth (with a secondary index on it) and country of residence:</p><p><b>CREATE</b> <b>INDEX</b> <b>ON</b> <b>users</b>(birth_year);</p><p>Then the following queries are valid:</p><p><b>Query 1: SELECT</b> <b>*</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>users</b>;</p><p><b>Query 2: SELECT</b> <b>*</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>users</b> <b>WHERE</b> birth_year <b>=</b> 1981;</p><p>However, the following query will be rejected:</p><p><b>Query 3: SELECT</b> <b>*</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>users</b> <b>WHERE</b> birth_year <b>=</b> 1981 <b>AND</b> country <b>=</b> ‘AU’;</p><p>This is because Cassandra cannot guarantee that it won’t have to scan a large amount of data even if the result of the query is small. Typically, it will scan all the index entries for users born in 1981 even if only a handful are actually from Australia. However, if you “know what you are doing”, you can force the execution of this query by using ALLOW FILTERING and so the following query is valid:</p><p><b>Query 3 (with ALLOW FILTERING):SELECT * FROM users WHERE birth_year = 1981 AND country = ‘AU’ ALLOW FILTERING;</b></p><p>When using secondary indexes, it is important to understand that all three of these queries will need to hit every node in the cluster (or at least a complete set of replicas) in order to return results. In queries like this in Cassandra, one node in the cluster will act as the coordinator node, send out the query to the other nodes in the cluster that need to participate and collating the results to send back to the client. For Query 2, the coordinator will need to send a subquery  to each node in the cluster which in turn will look up the index for the data it stores and return matching rows to the coordinator which in turn returns them to the client. Query 3 is executed in much the same manner but the individual nodes not only look up the index and return data but also filter it before returning. </p><p>Thus for Query 3 the size of the result set is not related to the amount of data scanned and ALLOW FILTERING is required. However, both Query 2 and Query 3 require all nodes in the cluster to participate in the query and thus the amount of work required to complete the query increases as the cluster size grows and you will not see the linear horizontal scaling that Cassandra is famous for.</p><p>So, while ALLOW FILTERING should definitely be avoided, any query that does not specify a partition key should also be avoided to enable your Cassandra cluster to scale.</p>",

Also, check that <u>all</u> of the keyspaces that will be copied over to the new cluster are set to use NetworkTopologyStrategy as their replication strategy. It’s also recommended that all keyspaces use this replication strategy when created, as altering this later can become complicated.</p></section><section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"2) Create the new cluster\"><h3 class=\"section-title\"><i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\">2) Create the new cluster</i></h3><p>Now it’s time to create the new cluster that you’ll be migrating to. A few things to be careful about here: be sure that the new cluster and the original cluster use the same Cassandra version and cluster name. Also, the new datacenter name that you use must be different from the name of the existing datacenter.</p></section><section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"3) Join the clusters together\"><h3 class=\"section-title\"><i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\">3) Join the clusters together</i></h3><p>To do this, first make any necessary firewall rule changes in order to allow the clusters to be joined, remembering that some changes to the source cluster may also be necessary. Then, change the new cluster’s seed nodes – and start them. Once this is done, the new cluster will be a second datacenter in the original cluster.</p></section><section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"4) Change the replication settings\"><h3 class=\"section-title\"><i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\">4) Change the replication settings<strong> </strong></i></h3><p>Next, in the existing cluster, update the replication settings for the keyspaces that will be copied, so that data will now be replicated with the new datacenter as the destination.</p></section><section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"5) Copy the data to the new cluster\"><h3 class=\"section-title\"><i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\">5) Copy the data to the new cluster</i></h3><p>When the clusters are joined together, Cassandra will begin to replicate writes to the new cluster. It’s still necessary, however, to copy any existing data over with the nodetool rebuild function. It’s a best practice to perform this function on the new cluster one or two nodes at a time, so as not to place an overwhelming streaming load on the existing cluster.</p></section><section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"6) Change over the application’s connection points\"><h3 class=\"section-title\"><i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\">6) Change over the application’s connection points</i></h3><p>After all uses of the rebuild function are completed, each of the clusters will contain a complete copy of the data being migrated, which Cassandra will keep in sync automatically. It’s now time to change the initial connection points of your application over to the nodes in the new cluster. Once this is completed, all reads and writes will be served by the new cluster, and will subsequently be replicated in the original cluster. Finally, it’s smart to run a repair function across the cluster, in order to ensure that all data has been replicated successfully from the original.<strong> </strong></p></section><section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"7) Shut down the original cluster\"><h3 class=\"section-title\"><i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\">7) Shut down the original cluster</i></h3><p>Complete the process with a little post-migration clean up, removing the original cluster. First, change the firewall rules to disconnect the original cluster from the new one. Then, update the replication settings in the new cluster to cease replication of data to the original cluster. Lastly, shut the original cluster down.</p><p>There you have it: your Apache Cassandra deployment has been fully migrated, with zero downtime, low risk and in a manner completely seamless and transparent from the perspective of your end users.</p><p><em>You can follow </em><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/instaclustr?lang=en\">Instaclustr on Twitter</a>.</em></p><p><img class=\"wp-align alignnone size-full wp-image-1934\" src=\"https://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/open-source-insider/files/2017/11/111P0AlzIUIAA0fc-.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"580\" height=\"441\" srcset=\"https://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/open-source-insider/files/2017/11/111P0AlzIUIAA0fc-.jpg 580w, https://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/open-source-insider/files/2017/11/111P0AlzIUIAA0fc--300x228.jpg 300w\" /></p></section>",

Instaclustr also co-locates all of these services on the same nodes by default. </p><p>I’ve spent some time examining the Kafka documentation to check what related ecosystem services it can connect to, and in what direction. Kafka supports Source and Sink Connectors which enable integration with numerous other services. Lots of different event sources are supported, enabling data to be ingested from both external and internal devices and systems. AWS S3 is supported as a Kafka sink only, and JDBC as both source and sink. Elassandra is supported as a sink only, and Spark Streaming and Cassandra as source and sink. </p><p>Also note that implicitly most services can “talk to” themselves (i.e. read data from, process data, and write data back. This is what the card replacement rule achieves). What’s more interesting is that they can also interact with themselves on the same or different <i>clusters</i>, and for the same or different <i>locations</i> (e.g. in another AWS AZ, or in another region). The diagram shows a Service interacting with itself (same cluster), another instance of the service in the same location (different cluster), and another instance in a different cluster and location (different location):</p><p><a href=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Architecture-Diagram-2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8011\" src=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Architecture-Diagram-2.png\" alt=\"Kafka Architecture Diagram\" width=\"3631\" height=\"1973\" srcset=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Architecture-Diagram-2.png 3631w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Architecture-Diagram-2-300x163.png 300w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Architecture-Diagram-2-768x417.png 768w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Architecture-Diagram-2-1024x556.png 1024w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Architecture-Diagram-2-966x525.png 966w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Architecture-Diagram-2-640x348.png 640w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Architecture-Diagram-2-88x48.png 88w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Architecture-Diagram-2-199x108.png 199w\" /></a></p><p>This opens up powerful internal service architectural richness and use cases. For example: Differentiation of clusters running the same service (e.g. write-intensive Cassandra cluster feeding data into a read-intensive cassandra cluster); A Kafka cluster dedicated to ingestion only, connecting to others for processing; mirroring or replicating data from one Cassandra cluster (location) to another (e.g. using Spark to read from a Cassandra cluster in one location and write to a Cassandra cluster in another location); Peer-to-Peer Kafka clusters, where each cluster subscribes to events that are local to all other Kafka clusters and aggregates the events locally), etc.</p><h2>Kafka – some key features</h2><p><a href=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Some-key-features-of-Apache-Kafka.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8012\" src=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Some-key-features-of-Apache-Kafka.png\" alt=\"Key features of Apache Kafka\" width=\"604\" height=\"513\" srcset=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Some-key-features-of-Apache-Kafka.png 604w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Some-key-features-of-Apache-Kafka-300x255.png 300w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Some-key-features-of-Apache-Kafka-57x48.png 57w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Some-key-features-of-Apache-Kafka-127x108.png 127w\" /></a></p><p>The main Kafka APIs are Connectors, Producers, Consumers and Streams. Kafka is stream event-based, and producers publish events onto one or more topics. Topics are multi-subscriber and can have zero or more consumers that process events. Kafka maintains a (partitioned) immutable commit log of events for each topic, and therefore keeps all published events for a specified retention period. This approach for message processing has a number of benefits. The more obvious benefits are speed, fault-tolerance, high concurrency and scalability. The surprising benefits are that consumers and producers can be very loosely coupled, and events can be shared! More than one consumer can consume the same event, and consumers also control which events to consume – they can consume new events and also re-consume past events.</p><p>Kafka’s performance is claimed to be constant with respect to data size, so storing events for an arbitrary length of time (as long as you have disk space!) is encouraged, by design. Because events can be processed more than once, by the same or different consumers, what do we end up with? A database for streaming events!</p><p>Let’s explore some permutations of the ecosystem of services (not all permutations will be covered in this blog), starting with Kafka.  In answer to the question “What is Kafka good for?”, the Kafka documentation suggests two broad classes of application. The focus of this blog is on the first use case – getting (streaming) data between systems.</p><ol><li>Building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between systems or applications (this blog)</li> <li>Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react to the streams of data (next blog).</li> </ol><h2>Use Case: Kafka as a Database (Teenagers bedroom.

All the events arriving will be published to topic(s), and persisted to disk. Events can subsequently be consumed multiple times by multiple consumers, who do not have to be subscribed yet. Is this interesting? Yes! It suggests lots of powerful use cases around event persistence, and reprocessing/replaying of events, and adding derived events (e.g. failure handling, support for multiple consumers and purposes for DevOps to maintain derived stateful data back in Kafka for future use, as well as for processing events from past, present and future, including predictions, in a unified manner).</p><h2>Use Case: Kafka as a temporary Buffer (Doctors waiting room)</h2><p><a href=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Kafka-as-a-temporary-Buffer.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8016\" src=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Kafka-as-a-temporary-Buffer.png\" alt=\"Kafka as a temporary buffer\" width=\"798\" height=\"524\" srcset=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Kafka-as-a-temporary-Buffer.png 798w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Kafka-as-a-temporary-Buffer-300x197.png 300w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Kafka-as-a-temporary-Buffer-768x504.png 768w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Kafka-as-a-temporary-Buffer-640x420.png 640w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Kafka-as-a-temporary-Buffer-73x48.png 73w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Kafka-as-a-temporary-Buffer-164x108.png 164w\" /></a></p><p>This pattern has one Kafka cluster feeding into another one:</p><p><a href=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Architecture-Diagram-4.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8017\" src=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Architecture-Diagram-4.png\" alt=\"Kafka Architecture Diagram\" width=\"3326\" height=\"1266\" srcset=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Architecture-Diagram-4.png 3326w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Architecture-Diagram-4-300x114.png 300w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Architecture-Diagram-4-768x292.png 768w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Architecture-Diagram-4-1024x390.png 1024w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Architecture-Diagram-4-966x368.png 966w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Architecture-Diagram-4-640x244.png 640w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Architecture-Diagram-4-126x48.png 126w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Architecture-Diagram-4-284x108.png 284w\" /></a></p><p>This “Buffer” (waiting room) pattern has a Kafka cluster dedicated solely to event ingestion, and another cluster for the event consumers.  This leverages the ability of Kafka to store events indefinitely, and isolate event producers from consumers.  The event production and consumption rates can be significantly different with no loss of events or overloading of consumers. This pattern is ideal for use cases where an incoming event storm can temporarily exceed the processing capacity of the consumers cluster, or if there is some other temporary failure or slowdown preventing the consumers processing events in real-time. The Ingestion cluster buffers all the events until the consumers are ready to process them again.

In particular, some less obvious patterns can be used to support <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/GuozhangWang/building-stream-infrastructure-across-multiple-data-centers-with-apache-kafka\">data replication across multiple Kafka clusters and locations</a>.  </p><p>There are a couple of use cases for data replication across clusters/locations. One is for reliability/redundancy and is often called active-passive replication. Data from the source (active) cluster is copied to the passive (target) cluster.  The “passive” cluster can be used in case of failure of the active cluster, or it can be used to reduce latency for consumers that are geo-located near it.</p><p><a href=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Architecture-Diagram-6.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8072\" src=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Architecture-Diagram-6.png\" alt=\"Kafka Architecture Diagram\" width=\"3905\" height=\"1519\" srcset=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Architecture-Diagram-6.png 3905w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Architecture-Diagram-6-300x117.png 300w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Architecture-Diagram-6-768x299.png 768w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Architecture-Diagram-6-1024x398.png 1024w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Architecture-Diagram-6-966x376.png 966w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Architecture-Diagram-6-640x249.png 640w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Architecture-Diagram-6-123x48.png 123w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Architecture-Diagram-6-278x108.png 278w\" /></a></p><h2>Use Case: Kafka active-active replication</h2><p>A more interesting use case is when unique events are collected at different locations, and must be shared among all the locations. This can be between just two locations, or many (P2P). This is an active-active pattern and can be viewed as a generalisation of the active-passive pattern as each cluster acts as both a source and a target for every other cluster, and the events copied from other clusters need to be merged with the events from the local cluster in a new topic (Topic 2 in the diagram below), from which consumers can get all the events. Note that it has to be different topic otherwise you get an event loop!</p><p><a href=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Architecture-Diagram-7.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8073\" src=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Architecture-Diagram-7.png\" alt=\"Kafka Architecture Diagram\" width=\"5012\" height=\"1632\" srcset=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Architecture-Diagram-7.png 5012w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Architecture-Diagram-7-300x98.png 300w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Architecture-Diagram-7-768x250.png 768w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Architecture-Diagram-7-1024x333.png 1024w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Architecture-Diagram-7-966x315.png 966w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Architecture-Diagram-7-640x208.png 640w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Architecture-Diagram-7-147x48.png 147w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Architecture-Diagram-7-332x108.png 332w\" /></a></p><h2>(Magic) Mirror Maker</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.kyotojournal.org/renewal/the-magic-mirror-maker/\"><i>In Japan, bronze mirrors are known as magic mirrors, or makkyo</i></a><i> (魔鏡).

One obvious mechanism is just to pretend that the clusters are “local”, and read data from the source cluster topic with a consumer and publish it to another topic on the target cluster. This approach can work with low-latency WANs (e.g. clusters on the same AWS AZ). However, there are also a number of more sophisticated solutions. <a href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#basic_ops_mirror_maker\">Mirror maker</a> can be used (which also just reads data from the source cluster using a consumer and publishes it to the target cluster using a producer!). Will mirror maker actually work for the active-active use case given that mirror maker can only read/write to/from topics of the same name? <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/2-way-replication-apache-kafka-marcio-andrada\">Maybe, here’s a trick.</a> More sophisticated solutions exist, including uReplicator from Uber.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://eng.uber.com/ureplicator/\">https://eng.uber.com/ureplicator/</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://github.com/uber/uReplicator\">https://github.com/uber/uReplicator</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://github.com/uber/uReplicator/wiki/uReplicator-Design\">https://github.com/uber/uReplicator/wiki/uReplicator-Design</a></li> </ul><h2>Next blog:</h2><h4>What’s the difference between Spark and Kafka Streaming?

These may be messages, events or similar transactions that have a time element to them.

In most applications there are business requirements about how long data will need to be held for and sometimes these requirements change. More and more, business want and are required to hold data for longer. For example, a lot of financial companies must keep audit data for up to seven years.</p><p><strong>Using some sample applications.</strong></p><p>We will look at some examples and see how time series is used for each.</p><p>1. A credit card account which shows transaction for a particular account number. Data is streamed in real time.</p><p>2. Collecting energy data for a smart meter. Data comes from files sent from devices after one day of activity.</p><p>3. Tick data for a financial instrument. Data is streamed in real time.</p><p>All of the above use cases are time series examples and would benefit from using Cassandra. But when we look at the queries and retention policies for this data we may look at different ways of storing them.</p><p><strong>Clustering columns for time series.</strong></p><p>The credit card application will need to query a users transactions and show them to the user. They will need to be in descending order with the latest transaction first. The data may be paged over multiple pages. This data needs to be kept for 7 years.</p><p>Using a simply clustering column in the table definition, will allow all the transactions for a particular account to be on one row for extremely fast retrieval.</p><p>Our table model would be similar to this</p><pre>create table if not exists latest_transactions(&#13;\n credit_card_no text,&#13;\n transaction_time timestamp,&#13;\n transaction_id text,&#13;\n user_id text,&#13;\n location text,&#13;\n items map&lt;text, double&gt;,&#13;\n merchant text,&#13;\n amount double,&#13;\n status text,&#13;\n notes text,&#13;\n PRIMARY KEY (credit_card_no, transaction_time)&#13;\n) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY ( transaction_time desc);</pre><p>The smart meter application is a little different. The data will come in for each meter no with data every 30 mins of increments to the meter value. Eg. 00:00 - 13, 00:30 11, 01:00 3......23:30 10. So the daily amount is an aggregation of all the data points together.</p><p>The business requirement state that the data must be held for 5 years and a days data will always be looked up together. Cassandra's has column type of Map which can be used to hold our daily readings in a format of time offset and value.</p><p>Our table model would look something like this</p><pre>create table if not exists smart_meter_reading (&#13;\n meter_id int,&#13;\n date timestamp,&#13;\n source_id text,&#13;\n readings map&lt;text, double&gt;,&#13;\n PRIMARY KEY(meter_id, date)&#13;\n) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY(date desc);</pre><p>This seems sensible until we look at how much data we will be holding and for how long. This application has 10 Million meters and hopes to double that over the next 3 years. If we start at 10M customers holding 365*5 years of data which 48 columns of offset data per day (every half hour), this can quickly add up to over 50o billion points (a map of 48 entries is held as 48 columns) and we haven't talked about the increase over those years. Since we don't have to query the reading individually it might suit better to look at other storage capabilities. A map can be simply transformed to and from a JSON string which would allow us to hold the same data but not have the over head of all the columns.</p><pre>create table if not exists smart_meter_reading (&#13;\n meter_id int,&#13;\n date timestamp,&#13;\n source_id text,&#13;\n readings text,&#13;\n PRIMARY KEY(meter_id, date)&#13;\n) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY(date desc);</pre><p>So instead of 500 billion points we now have 5 billion.</p><p>Now we finally look at application no 3. In this case we have data streaming to our application for thousands of different instruments. We can expect on 100,000 ticks a day on some of the instruments. If the requirement is to hold this data long term and be able to create different views of the data for charting capabilities, the storage requirement will be extremely large.</p><p><strong>Collecting data vs Storing data.</strong></p><p>We can collect the data in the traditional way using a clustering column with a table like so</p><pre>CREATE TABLE tick_data ( &#13;\n symbol text,&#13;\n date timestamp,&#13;\n time_of_day timestamp,&#13;\n value double,&#13;\n PRIMARY KEY ((symbol,time_of_day), date)&#13;\n) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (date DESC);</pre><p>When we think of keeping this data long term we have to understand the implications of having billions of columns in our tables. Our normal queries will be charting the last 5 days of instrument data in 15 min intervals or show the open, high, low and close of an instrument for the last 10 days in 30 mins intervals. So 99% of the queries will be looking at the whole days data. In this example we can then change the long term storage for this table to create a second table which handles any requests for data that is not today. At the end of each day we can compress and the store the data more efficiently for the rest of its life in the database.</p><p>For example we can use the following</p><pre>CREATE TABLE tick_data_binary ( &#13;\n symbol text,&#13;\n date timestamp;&#13;\n dates blob,&#13;\n ticks blob,&#13;\n PRIMARY KEY ((symbol,date))&#13;\n);</pre><p>Inserting into the tick_data_binary table can sustain inserts and reads of around 5 million ticks per server,  compared to 25000 for the tick_data table. The tick_data_binary table is also three times less storage that the tick_data table. This is not surprising as instead of holding 100,000 TTLs for all the columns, in the binary example we only hold 1. But there are bigger advantages when it comes to Cassandra's management services like compaction and repair. Compaction needs to be able to search for tombstones(deleted columns) which means that the more columns we have, the longer compaction can take. A similar problem arises in repair as this is in fact a compaction job. Comparing the repair time of a table with clustering columns and a table with binary data shows an increase of 10 times for the clustering table over the binary table.</p><h2>Trade offs</h2><p>There are always trade offs to each of the models above. For example the binary data in particular can't be filtered using CQL, the filtering needs to happen in some code. This post isn't supposed to be a catch all for time series applications but it it is supposed to help with the modelling of your data, both current and future, and the thought process that goes into that. In particular, don't be afraid to change the data model structure once its usefulness has decreased.</p><p>Check out <a href=\"https://academy.datastax.com/tutorials\">https://academy.datastax.com/tutorials</a> for more information of Cassandra and data modelling.

The two disk pass approach of secondary indexes, one for reading the secondary index file and second for accessing the actual data makes it inefficient in terms of performance. You can read more on this <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/cassandra-native-secondary-index-deep-dive\" data-href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/cassandra-native-secondary-index-deep-dive\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><h3 id=\"cb39\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Replication in Cassandra</h3><p id=\"3c49\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Cassandra supports async replication based on a specified replication factor. Consider a scenario where you have 99 partitions with a replication factor of 3. Cassandra will replicate data of each partition on two other partitions. As a result, if a query requests to read all data, Cassandra can find the required data by reading only 33 partitions, hence reducing the number of partitions to read. Replication not only plays an important role in read optimization, but more importantly, it enables fault tolerance by ensuring access to data in case some node goes down in a Cassandra cluster.</p><h3 id=\"a025\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Cassandra Tips</h3><p id=\"0312\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Here are some tips that may come handy during your journey through Cassandra.</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li id=\"893c\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Test your data model as early as possible.

One has partition key <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">username</strong> and other one <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">email</strong>. Note that we are duplicating information (age) in both tables.</p><figure id=\"ad1f\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*WEKG9Khc-se7Nnc5dts0pw.png\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"393\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*WEKG9Khc-se7Nnc5dts0pw.png\" alt=\"image\" /></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\"><a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/basic-rules-of-cassandra-data-modeling\" data-href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/basic-rules-of-cassandra-data-modeling\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/basic-rules-of-cassandra-data-modeling</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"ca68\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Another way to model this data could be what’s shown above. In this case we have three tables, but we have avoided the data duplication by using last two tables as reference tables. Just like before reference tables are partitioning the data using username and email, but user details are located at a single place.</p><p id=\"8559\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">So which data model is better?</em></strong></p><p id=\"b752\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Recall two primary rules of data modelling in Cassandra (1) each partition should have roughly same amount of data (2) read operations should access minimum partitions, ideally only one.</p><p id=\"3466\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If we apply these rules to model #1, we will only need to access one partition to get full user details. Additionally, we can easily find which partition contains our data as both username and email have been used as partition key. Assuming usernames and emails have uniform distribution, we will have roughly same quantity of data in each partition.</p><p id=\"6f19\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Now, lets evaluate model #2. Although there is no data duplication in this model (keep in mind it’s okay to have data duplication as long as it optimizes read performance) but it comes with one big disadvantage: it violates the rule of reading from a single partition. To find user details, first we will go to a partition using username (or email), and then we will do another partition lookup through uuid.</p><p id=\"e579\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Therefore, in this scenario it is better to use model #1.</p><h4 id=\"ca69\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Example 2</h4><p id=\"e845\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Our requirements have been updated. Now, each user belongs to a group. And we want to fetch all users of a group by group name including all details of its users.</p><figure id=\"4aee\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*8srORb1aPHlpw6qNyLU8-g.png\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"158\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*8srORb1aPHlpw6qNyLU8-g.png\" alt=\"image\" /></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\"><a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/basic-rules-of-cassandra-data-modeling\" data-href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/basic-rules-of-cassandra-data-modeling\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/basic-rules-of-cassandra-data-modeling</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"250b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Here, data will be distributed among nodes based on group_name (partition key) and sorted within a node by username (clustering key). Each group stores complete information of its users.</p><p id=\"0d75\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Our proposed model satisfies the first data modeling principle, i.e. to read any group’s data we will have to hit only a single partition and there will find all users of that group. But does this model satisfy the 2nd principle? The answer is probably not. Why? Because generally, in the real world, there will be some very populated groups while other groups might be very small. Which means the size of partitions won’t be roughly same, and that is violation of our data modelling principle.</p><p id=\"f011\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One way to fix this could be this model</p><figure id=\"590f\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*uYkMW2vouxRfzvtELjIyPg.png\" data-width=\"1218\" data-height=\"344\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*uYkMW2vouxRfzvtELjIyPg.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uYkMW2vouxRfzvtELjIyPg.png\" alt=\"image\" /></div></figure><p id=\"6e9d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Now we are using a composite partition key, where hash_prefix is a just random number. This composite key will ensure that data is uniformly distributed among nodes hence our model no longer violates the 2nd principle. But it comes with a catch. As data will be distributed uniformly among partitions, in order to fetch all users in a particular group we will have to read more than one partition, hence violating the 1st principle.</p><p id=\"ae76\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This example teaches us an interesting lesson in Cassandra data modelling.</p><blockquote id=\"aab7\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><div>The two data modeling principles often conflict, therefore you have to find a balance between the two based on domain understanding and business needs.</div></blockquote><h4 id=\"156e\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--blockquote\">Example 3</h4><p id=\"5563\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Continuing on the previous examples, our new requirement is to add support for getting X newest users in a group. Here is one data model</p><figure id=\"19cf\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*5LesR_IYYrlRIh_qjnHzLA.png\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"188\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*5LesR_IYYrlRIh_qjnHzLA.png\" alt=\"image\" /></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\"><a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/basic-rules-of-cassandra-data-modeling\" data-href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/basic-rules-of-cassandra-data-modeling\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/basic-rules-of-cassandra-data-modeling</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"38bd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">All user data is located at a single place, data is partitioned by group_name and ordered by join date. [Ignoring the issue of data distribution we already discussed in last example] Model looks decent. Lookup by group name would take us to exact partition containing group data, sorting by join date means we only need to read last X records from the end. There is one further improvement we can do on this model which will make our queries more faster.</p><figure id=\"7059\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*qEjC070JbN_KlBw0dilqFA.png\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"167\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*qEjC070JbN_KlBw0dilqFA.png\" alt=\"image\" /></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\"><a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/basic-rules-of-cassandra-data-modeling\" data-href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/basic-rules-of-cassandra-data-modeling\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/basic-rules-of-cassandra-data-modeling</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"3c28\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Here, we are still sorting the partition data by join date, but in descending order. Now, we won’t even need to go to end of partition in order to read last X records. We can simply read top X records from the start of partition, hence reducing the IO cost.</p><p id=\"8a50\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Recall the data distribution problem we touched upon earlier, one way to solve that could be this.</p><figure id=\"14ec\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*F-ij4Ec1viZHqe2i1ZWazQ.png\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"163\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*F-ij4Ec1viZHqe2i1ZWazQ.png\" alt=\"image\" /></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\"><a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/basic-rules-of-cassandra-data-modeling\" data-href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/basic-rules-of-cassandra-data-modeling\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/basic-rules-of-cassandra-data-modeling</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"b2d5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">We have made the partition key composite by adding join date. This way a new partition will be created everyday for every group. Assuming each group is roughly inducting same number of users daily, this model can work. But now, in order to get last X joined users in a group, we will have to read more than one partition if number of users who joined that group in last day are less than X. One way to fix this could be to benchmark the number of users joining daily and set the composite key in such a way that last X users query only need to access a single partition.</p><h4 id=\"047b\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Example 4</h4><p id=\"9064\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Let’s implement a simple Facebook use case where we need to fetch recent posts posted by a specific user.

First for keeping users with user Id as partition key, second for items with item Id as partition key, and third for storing user-item likes partitioned by unique Id assigned to each like record.</p><figure id=\"0a73\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*9MrS-S_85z1-d9q26sZmmw.png\" data-width=\"600\" data-height=\"307\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*9MrS-S_85z1-d9q26sZmmw.png\" alt=\"image\" /></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\"><a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/\" data-href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"cbb0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">If Ids are being auto generated, each partition will have roughly same amount of data which satisfies our first data modelling goal. Coming to partition reads, this data model will be able to find result of query #1 and #2 very efficiently as Id of each user and item is being used as partition key. But, there is no easy way to access data for query #3 and #4 because there is no way to predetermine what partitions might have the required data. Rather all partitions will have to be scanned, which violates our second data modelling principle.</p><p id=\"0800\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A better data modelling approach can be following.</p><figure id=\"a4f3\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*nRV637CWZknwzGup_dHfHQ.png\" data-width=\"600\" data-height=\"300\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*nRV637CWZknwzGup_dHfHQ.png\" alt=\"image\" /></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\"><a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/\" data-href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"671a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Here, we have divided the user-like relationship table into two by introducing data redundancy. Using this redundancy we are able to partition data by both user Id and item Id separately. This gives us the ability to look at specific partitions when finding results for query #3 and #4.</p><p id=\"77d7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But there is still one problem, note that we are only getting Ids i.e. user Id and item Id, from the newly introduced tables. In this design, we will still have to look up user and item partitions if we want to show meaningful information about users and items involved. Here is a quick fix, again using data duplication.</p><figure id=\"118b\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*1xDLAPSyOwB8TuoOggRSMA.png\" data-width=\"600\" data-height=\"301\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*1xDLAPSyOwB8TuoOggRSMA.png\" alt=\"image\" /></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\"><a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/\" data-href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"fb40\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">It is important to note here that we are not duplicating entire information of user or item in the relationship tables. For example, to show email or item description a lookup will still be required, but that decision is driven by business context. For example, in this case, we might be showing only user name or item title on initial interface and let user click on user/item for further details.</p><p id=\"ee5b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\"><a href=\"https://blog.emumba.com/apache-cassandra-part-6-time-series-modelling-b9b0ad2e96d9\" data-href=\"https://blog.emumba.com/apache-cassandra-part-6-time-series-modelling-b9b0ad2e96d9\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">Next: Apache Cassandra, Part 6: Time Series Modelling in Cassandra</a></p>",

Once the in-memory store is full, data is flushed onto disk in <a href=\"https://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/MemtableSSTable\" data-href=\"https://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/MemtableSSTable\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SSTables</a>.

You have a 2 node Cassandra cluster. You choose city name as partition key. To store this data Cassandra will create four partitions (against 4 unique cities), 2 on each node.</p><p id=\"9002\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Clustering Key</strong>: determines how data is sorted within a partition. Continuing on our last example, let’s say each incoming data point has a city name (A, B, C or D) and an associated timestamp. You can tell Cassandra to use timestamp as clustering key to store data in sorted order within a partition. This will enable efficient data lookup within a partition.</p><p id=\"8dcf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In short, partition key helps Cassandra in locating the node with specific data, while clustering key helps in efficiently finding data within a partition.</p><p id=\"1272\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Both partition and clustering key can be composite.</p><h3 id=\"3e08\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Column Family Store</h3><p id=\"e5b8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">As discussed earlier, Cassandra is neither a row based store nor it is a column based store, rather it is a column family store.

This makes it easy and cheap in terms of IO cost to read a single row. You go to desired row in a single disk seek, thanks to primary index, and find all the data in that row. Row oriented stores are efficient in scenarios where you need to access fewer rows and intend to use most of the data available in rows. This data access pattern is very common in OLTP systems, for example a university management, a banking portal, etc. But imagine if you need to find out median salary. For that you will have to scan the complete table and that will involve a lot of disk reads.</p><h4 id=\"2318\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Column Oriented Stores</h4><p id=\"ea57\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">A column oriented store would save the same information like this</p><figure id=\"a302\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*hcPyoCogQV82-68G.\" data-width=\"744\" data-height=\"180\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"0*hcPyoCogQV82-68G.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*hcPyoCogQV82-68G.\" alt=\"image\" /></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"eefe\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Here, unlike a row store, all column values from a particular column are stored together. Now, if we want to calculate median salary, it will be very fast because it involves only one disk seek. But, if we want to get complete information of a particular employee, we will end up doing a lot of IO operations.</p><p id=\"7e2f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In a column oriented store, number of values in each row should be same. This allows joining rows using index, which would be impossible to do if number of values are unequal. Column oriented stores are useful in OLAP scenarios where generally specific columns are of interest and queries are centered around these columns.</p><p id=\"a653\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Cassandra is neither a row oriented store nor it is a column oriented store, rather is is column family store. To understand how it is different from a row store, lets consider a scenario where we want to store temperature values. In a row based store we typically create a table temperatures with two columns (1) timestamp (2) value. On data insertion temperatures table will grow vertically. But in Cassandra, it can be a very valid design to store data like this:</p><figure id=\"98af\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*N_ZIad4Lno6A29Vs.\" data-width=\"912\" data-height=\"72\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"0*N_ZIad4Lno6A29Vs.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*N_ZIad4Lno6A29Vs.\" alt=\"image\" /></div></figure><p id=\"2973\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Here every new entry is creating a new column. (Cassandra supports up to 2 Billion columns).</p><p id=\"e94e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Now consider another example where we need to store various attributes of fruits. Following is a perfectly valid data model in Cassandra</p><figure id=\"ebf9\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*23NaTvtAEhU9hdg1.\" data-width=\"588\" data-height=\"170\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*23NaTvtAEhU9hdg1.\" alt=\"image\" /></div></figure><p id=\"781b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">But you cannot do this in a column oriented store because, recall, you have to have same number of columns for each row.</p><p id=\"dd0a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Hence, Cassandra is neither a row oriented store, nor it is a column oriented store because it does things differently than both of those. But the question remains: if Cassandra is a column family store then what exactly does it mean and how is it different ? Hang on, I cover this in future posts but first you need to understand a few core concepts of Cassandra.</p><p id=\"c1b3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\"><a href=\"https://blog.emumba.com/apache-cassandra-part-4-data-flow-and-key-concepts-4dea799a3531\" data-href=\"https://blog.emumba.com/apache-cassandra-part-4-data-flow-and-key-concepts-4dea799a3531\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">Next: Apache Cassandra, Part 4: Data Flow and Key Concepts</a></p>",

Each station would be transmitting data points at same rate, so each partition will have same amount of data. Hence the proposed data model satisfies both of the Cassandra’s data modelling goals.</p><p id=\"010a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But there is a problem, if a weather station transmits a new entry every second, we are will end up with huge partitions pretty soon. An improvement could be to create a composite partition key using station Id and date like this.</p><figure id=\"d516\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*3P0oxHxASLCry3qAP_Cjdg.png\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"144\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*3P0oxHxASLCry3qAP_Cjdg.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*3P0oxHxASLCry3qAP_Cjdg.png\" alt=\"image\" /></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\"><a href=\"https://academy.datastax.com/resources/getting-started-time-series-data-modeling\" data-href=\"https://academy.datastax.com/resources/getting-started-time-series-data-modeling\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://academy.datastax.com/resources/getting-started-time-series-data-modeling</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"bc62\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">This way we achieve manageable sized partitions and efficient date wise access to weather data.</p><p id=\"5d89\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In weather domain most of the queries will involve latest data. Our current model appends each new entry at the end, therefore, to find the latest N records Cassandra will go until the end of partition and read last N records.

In this blog post we will focus on how we approached the big challenge of scaling storage of viewing history data.</p><h3 id=\"ed8f\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Start Simple</h3><p id=\"c308\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">The first cloud-native version of the viewing history storage architecture used Cassandra for the following reasons:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li id=\"6268\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Cassandra has good support for <a href=\"https://academy.datastax.com/resources/getting-started-time-series-data-modeling\" data-href=\"https://academy.datastax.com/resources/getting-started-time-series-data-modeling\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">modelling time series data</a> wherein each row can have dynamic number of columns.</li><li id=\"4d7f\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">The viewing history data write to read ratio is about 9:1. Since Cassandra is <a href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.1/cassandra/dml/dml_manage_ondisk_c.html\" data-href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.1/cassandra/dml/dml_manage_ondisk_c.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">highly efficient with writes</a>, this write heavy workload is a good fit for Cassandra.</li><li id=\"b341\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Considering the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CAP theorem</a>, the team favors eventual consistency over loss of availability. Cassandra supports this tradeoff via <a href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/archived/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/dml/dml_config_consistency_c.html\" data-href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/archived/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/dml/dml_config_consistency_c.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tunable consistency</a>.</li></ul><p id=\"9944\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">In the initial approach, each member’s viewing history was stored in Cassandra in a single row with row key:CustomerId. This horizontal partitioning enabled effective scaling with member growth and made the common use case of reading a member’s entire viewing history very simple and efficient. However as member count increased and, more importantly, each member streamed more and more titles, the row sizes as well as the overall data size increased. Over time, this resulted in high storage and operation cost as well as slower performance for members with large viewing history.</p><p id=\"bae4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The following figure illustrates the read and write flows of the initial data model:</p><figure id=\"7224\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*QHOtYeP8F9J46FRq.\" data-width=\"720\" data-height=\"399\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"0*QHOtYeP8F9J46FRq.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*QHOtYeP8F9J46FRq.\" alt=\"image\" /></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1: Single Table Data Model</figcaption></div></figure><h3 id=\"2cea\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\">Write Flow</h3><p id=\"9835\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">One viewing record was inserted as a new column when a member started playing a title. That viewing record was updated after member paused or stopped the title. This single column write was fast and efficient.</p><h3 id=\"2494\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Read Flows</h3><p id=\"dd03\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Whole row read to retrieve all viewing records for one member:</em> The read was efficient when the number of records per member was small. As a member watched more titles, the number of viewing records increased. Reading rows with a large number of columns put additional stress on Cassandra that negatively impacted read latencies.</p><p id=\"443e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Time range query to read a time slice of a member’s data:</em> This resulted in the same inconsistent performance as above depending on the number of viewing records within the specified time range.</p><p id=\"0800\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Whole row read via pagination for large viewing history:</em> This was better for Cassandra as it wasn’t waiting for all the data to be ready before sending it back. This also avoided client timeouts. However it increased overall latency to read the whole row as the number of viewing records increased.</p><h3 id=\"febd\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Slowdown Reasons</h3><p id=\"65d1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Let’s look at some of the Cassandra internals to understand why our initial simple design slowed down. As the data grew, the number of <a href=\"https://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/MemtableSSTable\" data-href=\"https://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/MemtableSSTable\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SSTables</a> increased accordingly. Since only recent data was in memory, in many cases <a href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/5.1/dse-arch/datastax_enterprise/dbInternals/dbIntAboutReads.html\" data-href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/5.1/dse-arch/datastax_enterprise/dbInternals/dbIntAboutReads.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">both the memtables and SSTables had to be read</a> to retrieve viewing history. This had a negative impact on read latency. Similarly <a href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/5.1/dse-arch/datastax_enterprise/dbInternals/dbIntHowDataMaintain.html\" data-href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/5.1/dse-arch/datastax_enterprise/dbInternals/dbIntHowDataMaintain.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Compaction</a> took more IOs and time as the data size increased. <a href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/5.1/dse-arch/datastax_enterprise/dbArch/archRepairNodesReadRepair.html\" data-href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/5.1/dse-arch/datastax_enterprise/dbArch/archRepairNodesReadRepair.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Read repair</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/5.1/dse-arch/datastax_enterprise/dbArch/archAntiEntropyRepair.html\" data-href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/5.1/dse-arch/datastax_enterprise/dbArch/archAntiEntropyRepair.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Full column repair</a> became slower as rows got wider.</p><h3 id=\"988b\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Caching Layer</h3><p id=\"ae36\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Cassandra performed very well writing viewing history data but there was a need to improve the read latencies. To optimize read latencies, at the expense of increased work during the write path, we added an in-memory sharded caching layer (<a href=\"https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/announcing-evcache-distributed-in-memory-datastore-for-cloud-c26a698c27f7\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/announcing-evcache-distributed-in-memory-datastore-for-cloud-c26a698c27f7\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">EVCache</a>) in front of Cassandra storage. The cache was a simple key value store with the key being CustomerId and value being the compressed binary representation of viewing history data. Each write to Cassandra incurred an additional cache lookup and on cache hit the new data was merged with the existing value. Viewing history reads were serviced by the cache first. On a cache miss, the entry was read from Cassandra, compressed and then inserted in the cache.</p><p id=\"8385\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">With the addition of the caching layer, this single Cassandra table storage approach worked very well for many years. Partitioning based on CustomerId scaled well in the Cassandra cluster. By 2012, the Viewing History Cassandra cluster was one of the biggest dedicated Cassandra clusters at Netflix. To scale further, the team needed to double the cluster size. This meant venturing into uncharted territory for Netflix’s usage of Cassandra. In the meanwhile, Netflix business was continuing to grow rapidly, including an increasing international member base and forthcoming ventures into original content.</p><h3 id=\"3495\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Redesign: Live and Compressed Storage Approach</h3><p id=\"fd31\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">It became clear that a different approach was needed to scale for growth anticipated over the next 5 years. The team analyzed the data characteristics and usage patterns, and redesigned viewing history storage with two main goals in mind:</p><ol class=\"postList\"><li id=\"ab0b\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Smaller Storage Footprint.</li><li id=\"9eea\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Consistent Read/Write Performance as viewing per member grows.</li></ol><p id=\"2106\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">For each member, viewing history data is divided into two sets:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li id=\"5139\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--li-em\">Live or Recent Viewing History (LiveVH):</em> Small number of recent viewing records with frequent updates. The data is stored in uncompressed form as in the simple design detailed above.</li><li id=\"2972\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--li-em\">Compressed or Archival Viewing History (CompressedVH):</em> Large number of older viewing records with rare updates. The data is compressed to reduce storage footprint. Compressed viewing history is stored in a single column per row key.</li></ul><p id=\"5e85\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">LiveVH and CompressedVH are stored in different tables and are tuned differently to achieve better performance. Since LiveVH has frequent updates and small number of viewing records, compactions are run frequently and <a href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/5.1/dse-arch/datastax_enterprise/dbInternals/dbIntAboutDeletes.html\" data-href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/5.1/dse-arch/datastax_enterprise/dbInternals/dbIntAboutDeletes.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gc_grace_seconds</a> is small to reduce number of SSTables and data size. <a href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/5.1/dse-arch/datastax_enterprise/dbArch/archRepairNodesReadRepair.html\" data-href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/5.1/dse-arch/datastax_enterprise/dbArch/archRepairNodesReadRepair.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Read repair</a> and<a href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/5.1/dse-arch/datastax_enterprise/dbArch/archAntiEntropyRepair.html\" data-href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/5.1/dse-arch/datastax_enterprise/dbArch/archAntiEntropyRepair.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> full column family repair</a> are run frequently to improve data consistency. Since updates to CompressedVH are rare, manual and infrequent full compactions are sufficient to reduce number of SSTables. Data is checked for consistency during the rare updates. This obviates the need for read repair as well as full column family repair.</p><h3 id=\"3c67\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Write Flow</h3><p id=\"dae1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">New viewing records are written to LiveVH using the same approach as described earlier.</p><h3 id=\"06e7\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Read Flows</h3><p id=\"d975\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">To get the benefit of the new design, the viewing history API was updated with an option to read recent or full data:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li id=\"d3b2\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--li-em\">Recent Viewing History:</em> For most cases this results in reading from LiveVH only, which limits the data size resulting in much lower latencies.</li><li id=\"49a7\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--li-em\">Full Viewing History:</em> Implemented as parallel reads of LiveVH and CompressedVH. Due to data compression and CompressedVH having fewer columns, less data is read thereby significantly speeding up reads.</li></ul><h3 id=\"24b1\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--li\">CompressedVH Update Flow</h3><p id=\"79c5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">While reading viewing history records from LiveVH, if the number of records is over a configurable threshold then the recent viewing records are rolled up, compressed and stored in CompressedVH via a background task. Rolled up data is stored in a new row with row key:CustomerId. The new rollup is versioned and after being written is read to check for consistency. Only after verifying the consistency of the new version, the old version of rolled up data is deleted. For simplicity there is no locking during rollup and Cassandra takes care of resolving very rare duplicate writes (i.e., the last writer wins).</p><figure id=\"fdb3\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*VWfKAENoS8-OcyCL.\" data-width=\"720\" data-height=\"407\" data-is-featured=\"true\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"0*VWfKAENoS8-OcyCL.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*VWfKAENoS8-OcyCL.\" alt=\"image\" /></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2: Live and Compressed Data Model</figcaption></div></figure><p id=\"a2fb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">As shown in figure 2, the rolled up row in CompressedVH also stores metadata information like the latest version, object size and chunking information (more on that later). The version column stores a reference to the latest version of rolled up data so that reads for a CustomerId always return only the latest rolled up data. The rolled up data is stored in a single column to reduce compaction pressure. To minimize the frequency of rollups for members with frequent viewing pattern, just the last couple of days worth of viewing history records are kept in LiveVH after rollup and the rest are merged with the records in CompressedVH during rollup.</p><h3 id=\"0727\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Auto Scaling via Chunking</h3><p id=\"c814\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">For the majority of members, storing their entire viewing history in a single row of compressed data resulted in good performance during the read flows. For a small percentage of members with very large viewing history, reading CompressedVH from a single row started to slow down due to similar reasons as described in the first architecture. There was a need to have an upper bound on the read and write latencies for this rare case without negatively impacting the read and write latencies for the common case.</p><p id=\"b2e0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To solve for this, we split the rolled up compressed data into multiple chunks if the data size is greater than a configurable threshold. These chunks are stored on different Cassandra nodes. Parallel reads and writes of these chunks results in having an upper bound on the read and write latencies even for very large viewing data.</p><figure id=\"dcc2\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*rQ0DZVO0oR_MHVNg.\" data-width=\"720\" data-height=\"647\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"0*rQ0DZVO0oR_MHVNg.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*rQ0DZVO0oR_MHVNg.\" alt=\"image\" /></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 3: Auto Scale via Chunking</figcaption></div></figure><h4 id=\"7720\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure\">Write Flow</h4><p id=\"be96\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">As figure 3 indicates, rolled up compressed data is split into multiple chunks based on a configurable chunk size. All chunks are written in parallel to different rows with row key:CustomerId$Version$ChunkNumber. Metadata is written to its own row with row key:CustomerId after successful write of the chunked data. This bounds the write latency to two writes for rollups of very large viewing data. In this case the metadata row has an empty data column to enable fast read of metadata.</p><p id=\"bd49\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To make the common case (compressed viewing data is smaller than the configurable threshold) fast, metadata is combined with the viewing data in the same row to eliminate metadata lookup overhead as shown in figure 2.</p><h4 id=\"80df\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Read Flow</h4><p id=\"ba04\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">The metadata row is first read using CustomerId as the key. For the common case, the chunk count is 1 and the metadata row also has the most recent version of rolled up compressed viewing data. For the rare case, there are multiple chunks of compressed viewing data. Using the metadata information like version and chunk count, different row keys for the chunks are generated and all chunks are read in parallel. This bounds the read latency to two reads.</p><h3 id=\"3434\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Caching Layer Changes</h3><p id=\"e1c0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">The in-memory caching layer was enhanced to support chunking for large entries. For members with large viewing history, it was not possible to fit the entire compressed viewing history in a single EVCache entry. So similar to the CompressedVH model, each large viewing history cache entry is broken into multiple chunks and the metadata is stored along with the first chunk.</p><h3 id=\"1e53\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Results</h3><p id=\"c4d8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">By leveraging parallelism, compression, and an improved data model, the team was able to meet all of the goals:</p><ol class=\"postList\"><li id=\"b384\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Smaller Storage Footprint via compression.</li><li id=\"5920\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Consistent Read/Write Performance via chunking and parallel reads/writes. Latency bound to one read and one write for common cases and latency bound to two reads and two writes for rare cases.</li></ol><figure id=\"c6e1\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--li\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*t2YDONTlaJIDxDnf.\" data-width=\"720\" data-height=\"400\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"0*t2YDONTlaJIDxDnf.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*t2YDONTlaJIDxDnf.\" alt=\"image\" /></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 4: Results</figcaption></div></figure><p id=\"3d8e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The team achieved ~6X reduction in data size, ~13X reduction in system time spent on Cassandra maintenance, ~5X reduction in average read latency and ~1.5X reduction in average write latency. More importantly, it gave the team a scalable architecture and headroom to accommodate rapid growth of Netflix viewing data.</p><p id=\"97a7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">In the next part of this blog post series, we will explore the latest scalability challenges motivating the next iteration of viewing history storage architecture.

Adding a node to the cluster redistributes the data in a manner transparent to the client and increases write throughput more-or-less linearly (actually somewhat sub-linear in our tests)¹. Cassandra also provides tunable availability with its <a href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql/3.3/cql/cql_using/useUpdateKeyspaceRF.html\" data-href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql/3.3/cql/cql_using/useUpdateKeyspaceRF.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">replication factor</a> configuration, which determines the number of nodes that have a copy of a given piece of data.</p><p id=\"5447\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB support scaling out reads by way of <a href=\"https://blog.timescale.com/scalable-postgresql-high-availability-read-scalability-streaming-replication-fb95023e2af\" data-href=\"https://blog.timescale.com/scalable-postgresql-high-availability-read-scalability-streaming-replication-fb95023e2af\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">streaming replication</a>. Each replica node can be used as a read node to increase read throughput. Although PostgreSQL does not natively provide scale-out write functionality, users can often get the additional throughput they need by using RAID disk arrays or leveraging the <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/manage-ag-tablespaces.html\" data-href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/manage-ag-tablespaces.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tablespace</a> functionality provided by PostgreSQL. In addition, unlike PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB allows users to (elastically) assign multiple tablespaces to a single hypertable if desired (e.g., multiple network-attached disks), creating the potential for massively scaling disk throughput on a single TimescaleDB instance. Moreover, as we’ll see, the write performance a single TimescaleDB instance provides for time-series data is quite often more than sufficient for a production workload — and that’s without some of the traditional NoSQL drawbacks that come with Cassandra.</p><h3 id=\"8e98\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Cassandra shortcomings: poor index support, no JOINs, restrictive query language, no referential integrity</h3><p id=\"0853\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">The dead simple scalability of Cassandra does not come without a cost. A number of key features that users of full-SQL databases like TimescaleDB take for granted are either not provided, very cumbersome, or not performant in Cassandra.</p><p id=\"563f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Indexes: </strong>Unlike traditional SQL databases, Cassandra does not support global indexes, often making it prohibitive to look up or filter data by anything other than the primary or clustering keys. Clustering keys, which we’ll discuss shortly, provide ordering only for a single “row” of data. Cassandra does support <a href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql/3.3/cql/cql_using/useSecondaryIndex.html\" data-href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql/3.3/cql/cql_using/useSecondaryIndex.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">secondary indexes</a>, but they are created <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">locally</em> on each node to preserve the scaleable writes of Cassandra. This means that <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">every</em> node must be queried each time an index lookup is performed, often leading to unacceptable performance.</p><p id=\"6192\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">JOINs</strong>: Cassandra is not a relational database and does not support natively joining data from two different sources. Users often have to create complex, error prone, and/or tedious client side logic to combine and filter data; indeed, this is what we had to do to get many of our benchmarking queries to be performant. While there are <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/2015/03/how-to-do-joins-in-apache-cassandra-and-datastax-enterprise\" data-href=\"https://www.datastax.com/2015/03/how-to-do-joins-in-apache-cassandra-and-datastax-enterprise\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tools available</a> for performing joins in Cassandra, they rely on implementing client-side joins either through heavyweight clients or standalone proxies in front of Cassandra itself.</p><p id=\"d99a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Query Language: </strong>Cassandra’s query language (<a href=\"http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cql/\" data-href=\"http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cql/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CQL</a>) lacks the expressiveness of SQL. Much of this has to do with some of the limitations brought on by Cassandra’s architecture. For example, the use of the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">WHERE</strong> clause is limited to primary or clustering keys or fields that have secondary indexes defined on them², otherwise the coordinator would need to retrieve data from every node in the cluster for each query. This is also true of the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">GROUPBY </strong>clause, which was only introduced in Cassandra 3.0. Another significant limitation for many application workflows is that you can only update data using its primary key. These and many other limitations make CQL a poor choice for workloads that require heavy analytical queries or data manipulation on fields beyond the primary and clustering keys.</p><p id=\"68f1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Referential Integrity</strong>: There is no concept of referential integrity in Cassandra. Any constraints that you would typically model as a foreign key relationship in SQL are impossible in Cassandra without writing custom code to enforce them on the client side.</p><p id=\"f83f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">These limitations typically translate to more complicated data models on the server side and <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">much</em> more complicated client-side logic than other databases we’ve benchmarked. We’ll see this on full display in the time-series data model we chose in order to make Cassandra as performant as possible.</p><p><a href=\"https://blog.dnsfilter.com/3-billion-time-series-data-points-dnsfilter-replaced-influxdb-with-timescaledb-d9f827702f8b\" data-href=\"https://blog.dnsfilter.com/3-billion-time-series-data-points-dnsfilter-replaced-influxdb-with-timescaledb-d9f827702f8b\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor\" title=\"https://blog.dnsfilter.com/3-billion-time-series-data-points-dnsfilter-replaced-influxdb-with-timescaledb-d9f827702f8b\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong\">Towards 3B time-series data points per day: Why DNSFilter replaced InfluxDB with TimescaleDB</strong><br /><em class=\"markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em\">Our results: 10x better resource utilization, even with 30% more requests</em>blog.dnsfilter.com</a></p><h3 id=\"387f\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--mixtapeEmbed\">Cassandra Data Model</h3><p id=\"9321\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">First, a quick note on the origins of our Cassandra data model.

Data for a column family, which is roughly analogous to a table in relational databases, is stored as a set of unique keys. Each of these keys maps to a set of columns which each contain the values for a particular data entry. These key-&gt;column-set tuples are called “rows” (but should not be confused with rows in a relational database).</p><p id=\"a1b9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In Cassandra, data is partitioned across nodes based on the column family key (called the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">primary</strong> or <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">partition</strong> key). Additionally, Cassandra allows for <a href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql/3.3/cql/cql_using/useCompoundPrimaryKeyConcept.html\" data-href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql/3.3/cql/cql_using/useCompoundPrimaryKeyConcept.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">compound primary keys</a>, where the first key in the key definition is the primary/partition key, and any additional keys are known as <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">clustering keys. </strong>These clustering keys specify columns on which to sort the data for each row.</p><p id=\"40ed\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Let’s take a look at how this plays out with the dataset we use for our benchmarks. We simulate a devops monitoring use case where 4,000 unique hosts report 10 CPU metrics every 10 seconds over the course of 3 days, resulting in a 100 million row dataset<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">.</em></p><p id=\"bc74\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In our Cassandra model, this translates to us creating a column family like this:</p><pre id=\"c399\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">CREATE TABLE measurements (<br />series_id text,<br />timestamp_ns bigint,<br />value double,<br />PRIMARY KEY(series_id, timestamp_ns));</pre><p id=\"efdf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">The primary key, <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">series_id</strong>, is a combination of the host, day, and metric type in the format <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">hostname#metric_type#day</strong>. This allows us to get around some of the query limitations of Cassandra discussed above, particularly the weak support for joins, indexes, and server side rollups. By encoding the host, metric type, and day into the primary key, we can quickly and easily access the subset of data we need and execute any further filtering, aggregation, and grouping more performantly on the client side.</p><p id=\"c82f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We use <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">timestamp_ns</strong> as our clustering key, which means that data for each row is ordered by timestamp as we insert it, providing optimal time range lookups. This is what a row of 3 values of the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">cpu_guest </strong>metric for a given host on a given day would look like:</p><figure id=\"d8ae\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*F3sTKziDqcErVBefj_hsEA.png\" data-width=\"2366\" data-height=\"724\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*F3sTKziDqcErVBefj_hsEA.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*F3sTKziDqcErVBefj_hsEA.png\" alt=\"image\" /></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--figure-strong\">A Cassandra data model with measurements stored over time</strong></figcaption></figure><p id=\"30f0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">This is what we meant when we mentioned the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">wide row approach</strong> earlier. Each row contains multiple columns, which are themselves sets of key-value pairs. The number of columns for a given row grows as we insert more readings corresponding to that row’s partition key. The columns are clustered by their timestamp, guaranteeing that each row will point to a sequentially sorted set of columns.</p><p id=\"e15a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This ordered data is passed down to our custom client, which maintains a fairly involved <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">client-side index</strong> to perform the filtering and aggregation that is not supported in a performant manner by Cassandra’s secondary indexes. We maintain a data structure that essentially duplicates Cassandra’s primary key-&gt;metrics mapping and performs filtering and aggregations as we add data from our Cassandra queries. The aggregations and rollups we do on the client side are very simple (min, max, avg, groupby, etc.), so the vast majority of the query time remains at the database level. (In other words, the client-side index works, but also takes a lot more work.)</p><h3 id=\"f115\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Insert Performance</h3><p id=\"a7eb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Unlike TimescaleDB, Cassandra does not work well with large batch inserts. In fact, batching as a performance optimization is <a href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql/3.3/cql/cql_using/useBatch.html\" data-href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql/3.3/cql/cql_using/useBatch.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">explicitly discouraged</a> due to bottlenecks on the coordinator node if the transaction hits many partitions. Cassandra’s <a href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/3.0/cassandra/configuration/configCassandra_yaml.html#configCassandra_yaml__advProps\" data-href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/3.0/cassandra/configuration/configCassandra_yaml.html#configCassandra_yaml__advProps\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">default maximum batch size setting</a> is very small at 5KB. Nonetheless, we found that a small amount of batching (batches of 100) actually did help significantly with insert throughput for our dataset, so we used a batch size of 100 for our benchmarks.</p><p id=\"3e53\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To give Cassandra a fair shake against TimescaleDB, which allows for far larger batch sizes (we use 10,000 for our benchmarks), we ramped up the number of concurrent workers writing to Cassandra. While we used just 8 concurrent workers to maximize our write throughput on TimescaleDB, we used 1,800 concurrent workers (spread across multiple client machines) to max out our Cassandra throughput. We tested worker counts from 1 up to 1,800 before settling on 1,800 as the optimal number of workers for maximizing write throughput. Any number of workers above that caused unpredictable server side timeouts and negligible gains (in other words, the tradeoff of latency for throughput became unacceptable).</p><p id=\"1b4b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To avoid client-side bottlenecks (e.g., with data serialization, the client-side index, or network overhead), we used 2 client VMs, each using our Golang benchmarker with 900 goroutines writing concurrently. We attempted to get more throughput by spreading the client load across even more VMs, but we found no improvements beyond 2 boxes.</p><p id=\"2835\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Since writes are sharded across nodes in Cassandra, its replication and consistency profile is a bit different than that of TimescaleDB. TimescaleDB writes all data to a single primary node which then replicates that data to any connected replicas through <a href=\"https://blog.timescale.com/scalable-postgresql-high-availability-read-scalability-streaming-replication-fb95023e2af\" data-href=\"https://blog.timescale.com/scalable-postgresql-high-availability-read-scalability-streaming-replication-fb95023e2af\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">streaming replication</a>. Cassandra, on the other hand, shards the writes across the cluster, so no single replica stores all the cluster’s data. Instead, you define the <a href=\"http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/architecture/dynamo.html#replication\" data-href=\"http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/architecture/dynamo.html#replication\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">replication factor</a> for a given keyspace, which determines <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">the number of nodes that will have a copy of each data item</em>. You can further<a href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/3.0/cassandra/dml/dmlConfigConsistency.html\" data-href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/3.0/cassandra/dml/dmlConfigConsistency.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> control the consistency</a> of each write transaction on the client side by specifying how many nodes the client waits for the data to be written to. PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB similarly offer <a href=\"http://docs.timescale.com/v0.9/tutorials/replication#Configure-Replication-Parameters\" data-href=\"http://docs.timescale.com/v0.9/tutorials/replication#Configure-Replication-Parameters\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tunable consistency</a>.</p><p id=\"4fc0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Given these significant differences, it’s difficult to achieve a truly apples-to-apples comparison of a 5 node TimescaleDB cluster vs. a 5 node Cassandra cluster. We decided on comparing a <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">TimescaleDB cluster with 1 primary and 4 read replicas, synchronous replication, and a </strong><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-replication.html#synchronous_standby_names\" data-href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-replication.html#synchronous_standby_names\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">consistency level of ANY 1</strong></a> against a <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">5 node Cassandra cluster with Replication Factor set to 2 and a consistency level of ONE</strong>. In both cases, clients will wait on data to be copied to 1 replica. Eventually data will be copied to 2 nodes in the case of Cassandra, while data will be copied to all nodes in the case of TimescaleDB.</p><p id=\"c3b0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">In theory,</strong> then, Cassandra should have an advantage in insert performance since writes will be sharded across multiple nodes.

Our multi-part primary key on Cassandra, on the other hand, provides no guarantee that all of the data in a given time range will even be on a single node. In practice, for queries like this that touch every host tag in the data set, we end up scanning most, if not all, of the nodes in a cluster and grouping on the client side.</p><h3 id=\"45bd\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Conclusion</h3><p id=\"3211\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">As we see, 5 TimescaleDB nodes outperform a 30 node Cassandra cluster, with higher inserts, up to 5800x faster queries, 10% the cost, a much more flexible data model, and full SQL.</strong></p><p id=\"868b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Cassandra’s turnkey write scalability comes at a steep cost. For all but the simplest rollup queries, our benchmarks show TimescaleDB with a large advantage, with average query times anywhere from 10 to 5,873 times faster for common time-series queries. While Cassandra’s clustered wide rows provide good performance for querying data for a single key, it quickly degrades for complex queries involving multiple rollups across many rows.</p><p id=\"2014\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Additionally, while Cassandra makes it easy to add nodes to increase write throughput, it turns out you often just don’t need to do that for TimescaleDB. With 10–15x the write throughput of Cassandra, a single TimescaleDB node with a couple of replicas for high availability is more than adequate for dealing with workloads that would require a 30+ node fleet of Cassandra instances to handle.</p><p id=\"d47f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">However, Cassandra’s scaling model does offer nearly limitless storage since adding more storage capacity is as simple as adding another node to the cluster. A single instance of TimescaleDB currently tops out around 50–100TB. If you need to store petabyte scale data and can’t take advantage of retention policies or rollups, then massively clustered Cassandra might be the solution for you. However, we’re actively working on a clustered version of TimescaleDB that will similarly allow users to add nodes to increase write throughput and storage capacity — so please stay tuned for more details.</p><p id=\"52f0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Also, we don’t claim to be Cassandra experts. We’ve tried to be as open as we can about our data models, configurations, and methodologies so readers can raise any concerns they may have about our benchmarks and help us make them as accurate as possible.</p><p id=\"1422\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">As a time-series database company we’ll always be quite interested in evaluating the performance of other solutions. Cassandra was a pleasure to work with in terms of scaling out write throughput. But attaining that at the cost of per-node performance, the vibrant PostgreSQL ecosystem, and the expressiveness of full SQL simply does not seem worth it.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Cassandra is a poster child of the NoSQL world. Originally an open source project sprung out of Facebook, it has been adopted by the Apache Foundation and backed by an enterprise, DataStax, that also offers DataStax Enterprise based on Cassandra. Cassandra is among the top 10 database solutions <a href=\"https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_trend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">according to DB-Engines</a>.</p><p>That is precisely why it now has a potentially dangerous rival in ScyllaDB. ScyllaDB is a new kid on the NoSQL block aiming to offer a solution that is open source and API-compatible with Cassandra, but performs much better. The goal is to be a drop-in replacement for Cassandra, and when we're talking about database #8 in the world, that's kind of a big deal.</p><h3>I, Cloudius</h3><p>Dor Laor and Avi Kivity did not set out with this grandiose plan back in 2013. It was not for lack of ambition, but this just was not their thing. They both have backgrounds in hypervisors and were <a href=\"http://www.eweek.com/cloud/how-did-kvm-virtualization-get-into-the-linux-kernel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">part of the team that built KVM and got acquired by Red Hat</a>. Leaving Red Hat, their initial plan was to write a unikernel that would displace Linux from cloud servers. So no lack of ambition there.</p><p>They founded a startup called Cloudius, found investors, assembled a team and started working hard. At some point however they realized that their potential would not be reached for a number of reasons, and decided to pivot. And pivot they did, to add another NoSQL database to the never ending list, one that would be able to do what Cassandra does and then some.</p><p>But why go for a NoSQL database, and why target Cassandra?</p><figure class=\"image  image-full-width shortcode-image\"><img src=\"https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/10/24/05b22e21-a725-4cf2-a42b-19683720c1ce/resize/770xauto/ed15875f35d515666d1a6365839b9a2c/scyllalogo2000px.png\" class=\"\" alt=\"scyllalogo2000px.png\" height=\"auto\" width=\"770\" /><figcaption>ScyllaDB did not start as a database at all, but having pivoted to one, it may prove a force to be reckoned with. Image: ScyllaDB.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Part of Cloudius mission was to speed up server loads, with an emphasis on databases. Laor, ScyllaDB CEO, says that they had managed to boost Redis performance by 70 percent without actually doing anything Redis-specific. You may wonder how was that possible, and there is an answer, but for now let's stick to the fact that this triggered them to take that direction.</p><p>It was a combination of market and technical reasons that made Cloudius target Cassandra. Laor says Hadoop was in their list as well, but since that had already been done they decided to go for rewriting Cassandra: \"The world does not need another database format. Cassandra's format is good, and it is successful. Cassandra is the best high availability platform out there.\"</p>\n    <section class=\"sharethrough-top\" data-component=\"medusaContentRecommendation\" data-medusa-content-recommendation-options=\"{&quot;promo&quot;:&quot;promo_ZD_recommendation_sharethrough_top_in_article_desktop&quot;,&quot;spot&quot;:&quot;dfp-in-article&quot;}\">\n    </section><p>They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and it's obvious from this that the ScyllaDB team found Cassandra worth imitating. But it's more complicated than that: \"Cassandra is everywhere in critical workloads. But when we targeted it for optimization, we ran against limitations tied to its JVM nature. In the end, Cassandra ends up competing with itself.</p><p>At that time, <a href=\"https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2014/03/cassandra-hits-one-million-writes-per-second-on-google-compute-engine.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google had just published a benchmark detailing how they managed to get 1 million transactions on top of Cassandra</a> in their cloud using 300 virtual machines. This piqued our interest, and focusing our work on Cassandra we managed to get a record 1.6 million transactions on one virtual machine. This is how we got started.\"</p><h3>Enter ScyllaDB</h3><p>Cloudius pivoted and rebranded, but kept the same team and investors. Thus ScyllaDB was born. You may think it's cheeky to target \"the best high availability platform out there\" and aim to do better, but Laor says they are hoping to see history repeating. And the entirety of that quote, \"imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness,\" may not necessarily apply here.</p><p>\"When we entered the market with KVM, all the players were established -- VMWare, HyperV, Xen. We showed up last, but based on Avi's revolutionary design KVM now dominates. We think our differentiation this time around is even bigger,\" says Laor.</p><p>So what is this differentiation? ScyllaDB promises something simple, alluring, and hard to believe: keep your codebase, replace Cassandra with ScyllaDB, get up to 10 times boost in performance. There are benchmarks and references to back those claims, but how can this possibly work? It comes down to a number of things.</p><figure class=\"image  image-full-width shortcode-image\"><img src=\"https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/10/24/965711a0-fe02-4bf3-833e-6f02393defcc/resize/770xauto/71f840138022af60b4c2268d1481950b/scylladbthemes.png\" class=\"\" alt=\"scylladbthemes.png\" height=\"auto\" width=\"770\" /><figcaption>ScyllaDB has been focused on stability, performance and compatibility. Today the announcement of version 2.0 signifies a new phase. Image: ScyllaDB</figcaption></figure><p>First, different implementation language. ScyllaDB has been rewritten from scratch in C++, as opposed to Cassandra's Java-based codebase. The JVM adds an intermediate layer between source code and hardware, trading portability and ease of use for performance. JVMs have come a long way, but the proper use of a language closer to the low-level fundamentals may result in better performance.</p><p>But that's only part of ScyllaDB's secret sauce. An equally big part has to do with those underlying fundamentals, such as memory or socket allocation. The kind of nitty gritty details that are hard to get, program, and maintain, but can result in dramatic improvements. The kind of thing that you get to know intimately if you program, say, a hypervisor.</p><p>All those lessons learned through years of low level programming have been distilled in <a href=\"https://github.com/scylladb/seastar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SeaStar</a>. SeaStar is an open source framework for high performance applications that ScyllaDB is built on, although there is nothing database-specific about it. SeaStar is event-driven and enables writing efficient non-blocking, asynchronous code. </p><p>The tradeoff? Complexity. Laor admits it's hard to program on top of SeaStar, but says the result is worth the effort. He mentions for example <a href=\"https://github.com/fastio/pedis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pedis</a>, a rewrite of Redis based on SeaStar done by Alibaba, which turbo-charges Redis. Besides, ScyllaDB promises, the average Cassandra user does not need to worry about that. </p><p>ScyllaDB aims to ease the complex task of configuring and tuning Cassandra deployments by offering auto-tuning capabilities. ScyllaDB has added improvements in both node management and network protocols with the goal of having clusters running optimally without requiring administrator intervention.</p><p>Laor compared this feature to <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/oracle-preps-autonomous-database-at-openworld-aims-to-cut-labor-admin-time/\" target=\"_blank\">Oracle's self tuning database</a>. There are however similar solutions for other platforms too, <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/spark-gets-automation-analyzing-code-and-tuning-clusters-in-production/\" target=\"_blank\">such as Spark</a>. For Spark, some approaches are based on using machine learning on datasets gathered from many operational clusters, some others on rules.</p><p>ScyllaDB has adopted the rule-based approach, as Laor does not believe datasets may be representative of all possible configurations. \"We use developer intelligence, not artificial intelligence,\" he says. Arguably, datasets from operational Cassandra clusters would be hard to come by for ScyllaDB anyway. Which brings us to an interesting point.</p><h3>A rock and a hard place</h3><p>On the one hand, the decision to build a new platform that is compatible with an existing one reduces friction and lowers the adoption barrier for organizations. ScyllaDB already has names such as Samsung, IBM, and Outbrain among its early <a href=\"http://www.scylladb.com/users/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">adopters using it in production</a>.</p><p>On the other hand, it induces friction with the platform the newcomer aims to displace: Cassandra. We've seen <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/towards-a-unifying-data-theory-and-practice-combining-operations-analytics-and-streaming/\" target=\"_blank\">similar examples in the Spark world</a>, but the difference is that Spark alternatives are still largely based on Spark so there can be cross-pollination and eventually perhaps convergence.</p><p>Here we're talking about a radical departure -- different implementation language, different low-level infrastructure, different network protocols. There really is no room for Cassandra and ScyllaDB to play side by side, as amply exemplified by the fact they cannot even coexist in a cluster.</p><figure class=\"image  image-full-width shortcode-image\"><img src=\"https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/10/24/8143b608-7510-4fb3-8c1f-ea35a654729e/resize/770xauto/3c34674788631b734ae6d73d4439dd21/scylladbbenchmark.png\" class=\"\" alt=\"scylladbbenchmark.png\" height=\"auto\" width=\"770\" /><figcaption>One of ScyllaDB's benchmarks, in which it is shown to outperform Cassandra. Image: ScyllaDB</figcaption></figure><p>Typically, Laor says, people set up a proof of concept ScyllaDB cluster working side by side with Cassandra until they feel confident enough to make the switch. \"We have different protocols. We considered supporting Cassandra protocols, but there are so many versions out there we decided against it. Plus, when things go wrong in a mixed cluster, whom will you blame?\"</p><p>Could that hurt adoption? \"We are not married to our databases, that's what people tell us,\" says Laor. \"It's a big investment, but they can change. Choosing Cassandra was a strategic decision for us. We started from scratch and rewrote everything. When you do that, you create antagonism. It touches many people, it's sensitive.</p><p>But the results speak for themselves. For example, an AdTech client of ours has managed to go from 100,000 timeouts per second with Cassandra to 100 per second with ScyllaDB. We have not been doing much in terms of collaboration, mostly because at the moment we are heads-down working on feature parity. But like KVM and Xen, where we had common interfaces, there may be potential for collaboration.\"</p><p>Laor mentions some areas in which they are contributing to the Cassandra community, such as ScyllaDB CTO presenting design choices at Cassandra next generation conference or contributing a driver for Go. He also emphasizes that ScyllaDB is an open source project and they try to document and disseminate design decisions and implementation and says they would like to work with Cassandra on certain features in the future.</p><p>ScyllaDB is a newcomer, but on paper at least it looks like it's got what it takes to displace a heavyweight such as Cassandra with DataStax's enterprise backing. The team has been there and done it before, feature parity is almost there, financials and organizational structure seem to be there as well.</p><p>ScyllaDB is well funded, with a total of $25 million, and has a team of 45 (mostly engineers) working together for years. On the technical front, it seems like ScyllaDB can give Cassandra a run for its money. But what does that \"hostile takeover\" mean for Cassandra, DataStax and the community? Will ScyllaDB be able to win hearts and minds?</p><p>It seems the Cassandra community is currently in somewhat of a turmoil anyway. There has been some <a href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/11/14/datastax_versus_asf_staxeit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">friction between DataStax and the Apache Foundation</a>, resulting in uncertainty about the project's future and direction. So to be a Cassandra user today may mean you are between a rock and a hard place.</p><figure class=\"image  image-full-width shortcode-image\"><img src=\"https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/10/24/8541e0a0-26dc-43b4-b9cc-16d10e67a501/resize/770xauto/b7ebbe39ddf7e4bbd0ea67a678f15a8d/scylladbcontributors.png\" class=\"\" alt=\"scylladbcontributors.png\" height=\"auto\" width=\"770\" /><figcaption>ScyllaDB plus SeaStar contributors are about as many as Cassandra contributors at this point, per ScyllaDB's accounts.

ScyllaDB on the other hand says their community is growing, despite the fact that the entry barrier is high due to the complex nature of their implementation, and that they have practically achieved feature parity.</p><p>ScyllaDB 2.0 is being announced today at <a href=\"http://www.scylladb.com/scylla-summit-2017/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scylla Summit</a>, bringing some highly sought after features such as counters and materialized views. According to Laor, full feature parity will be achieved in early 2018. Add to the mix the <a href=\"http://www.scylladb.com/press-release/scylladb-acquires-seastar-io-database-service-technology/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recent acquisition of Seastar.io</a>, which will act as a catalyst for ScyllaDB to offer a managed cloud version, and you see why ScyllaDB is a name you may be hearing more in the future.</p><p>Speaking of names, what's with ScyllaDB's name anyway? Apparently its founders wanted to use a name from Greek mythology, as <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Where-does-Apache-Cassandras-name-come-from#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">was the case for Cassandra</a>. According to them in some parts of the world \"Scylla\" is pronounced \"scale-ah,\" which alludes to scalability, and thus a name was born.</p><p>Ironically, Cassandra was an Oracle nobody would listen to. Scylla and Charybdis were <a href=\"https://history.howstuffworks.com/history-vs-myth/10-expressions-from-ancient-world4.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a monster and a whirlpool guarding the strait of Messina</a>, making it impossible to navigate past them. To be between Scylla and Charybdis is to be between a rock and a hard place. But to be between ScyllaDB and Cassandra may turn out to be a good thing for the community, should it eventually steer clear of the antagonism.</p>",

In a recent blog post, we demonstrated how Google Cloud Platform can rapidly provision and scale networking load to handle <a href=\"http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2013/11/compute-engine-load-balancing-hits-1-million-requests-per-second.html\">one million requests per second</a>. A fast front end without a fast backend has limited use, so we decided to demonstrate a backend serving infrastructure that could handle the same load. We looked at popular open source building blocks for cloud applications and choose <a href=\"http://cassandra.apache.org/\">Cassandra</a>, a NoSQL database designed for scale and simplicity.<p>Using 330 <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/products/compute-engine\">Google Compute Engin</a>e virtual machines, 300 1TB Persistent Disk volumes, Debian Linux, and Datastax Cassandra 2.2, we were able to construct a setup that can:<br /></p><ul><li>sustain one million writes per second to Cassandra with a median latency of 10.3 ms and 95% completing under 23 ms</li>\n<li>sustain a loss of ⅓ of the instances and volumes and still maintain the 1 million writes per second (though with higher latency)</li>\n<li>scale up and down linearly so that the configuration described can be used to create a cost effective solution</li>\n<li>go from nothing in existence to a fully configured and deployed instances hitting 1 million writes per second took just 70 minutes.

        "title": "Storing Nested Objects in Cassandra with Composite Columns",
        "url": "https://pkghosh.wordpress.com/2013/07/14/storing-nested-objects-in-cassandra-composite_columns/",
        "content": "<div class=\"pd-rating\" id=\"pd_rating_holder_3023117_post_1013\"><br /><p>One of the popular features of <em>MongoDB</em> is the ability to store arbitrarily nested objects and be able to index on any nested field. In this post I will show how to store nested objects in Cassandra using composite columns. I have recently added this feature to my open source Cassandra project <a href=\"https://github.com/pranab/agiato\" target=\"_blank\"><em>agiato</em></a>. Since in Cassandra, like many other NOSQL databases, stored data is highly denormalized. The denormalized data  often manifests itself in the form of a nested object e.g., denormalizing one to many relations.</p>\n<p>In the  solution presented here, the object data is stored in column families with composite columns. An object will typically have some statically defined fields. Rest of the fields will be dynamic. It is possible to define the table or column family behind the object in CQL3, based on the statically known fields of the object.</p>\n<h2>Composite Column</h2>\n<p>Super columns are frowned upon in Cassandra. Composite columns are the preferred approach. <a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/schema-in-cassandra-1-1\" target=\"_blank\">Composite columns</a> can do what super columns could do and more. The underlying data model in a super column is a 3 level nested map(including row key, super column name or key and column name or key). Composite columns are more flexible, allowing you to create a data model with multi level nested map.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of data model based on composite columns. Consider a building HVAC system with the sensor data  stored in a column family with composite columns. Here are the fields.</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><td>day</td>\n<td>day as integer</td>\n<td>20130421</td>\n</tr><tr><td>city</td>\n<td>city name</td>\n<td>Los Angeles</td>\n</tr><tr><td>buildingID</td>\n<td>An integer ID for a building</td>\n<td>2658</td>\n</tr><tr><td>sensorID</td>\n<td>An integer ID for a sensor in a building</td>\n<td>295016</td>\n</tr><tr><td>time</td>\n<td>timestamp as long</td>\n<td>1361237156</td>\n</tr><tr><td>temp</td>\n<td>temarature as double</td>\n<td>71.2</td>\n</tr><tr><td>humidity</td>\n<td>relative humidity as double</td>\n<td>30.7</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><p>A record is uniquely identified with the tuple <em>(day, city, buildingID, sensorID, time)</em>. The corresponding column family definition with composite key will be as below</p>\n<pre>create column family buildingControl \nwith key_validation_class = 'IntegerType'\nand comparator = 'CompositeType(UTF8Type, IntegerType, IntegerType, LongType, UTF8Type)'\nand default_validation_class='DoubleType';</pre>\n<p>The composite column along with row key provide a 6 level nested map. The composite column has 5 components. The first 4 correspond to the value of the  tuple <em>(city, buildingID, sensorID, time)</em>.  The last element is the name of a non primary column. The storage layout of a record will look as below</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">20130421</td>\n<td>Los Angeles:2658:295016:1361237156:temp</td>\n<td>Los Angeles:2658:295016:1361237156:humidity</td>\n</tr><tr><td>71.2</td>\n<td>30.7</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><p>The first 4 fields of the composite column name are the values of <em>(city, buildingID, sensorID, time) </em>values respectively, which are the clustering keys. The last component is the column name for a non primary key column. The value of the composite column is the corresponding non primary key column value.</p>\n<p>The composite column name is shown in a human readable form. Internally, the composite column name is stored with some byte encoding logic. As a nested Map,  a record, in this example can be represented as <em>Map&lt;Integer,Map&lt;String, Map&lt;Integer, Map&lt;Integer, Map&lt;Long, Map&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; . </em>Strictly speaking all the inner maps are sorted maps. As we will see later, in terms of CQL, the outer map corresponds to the row key and all the inner maps except for the last one correspond to the clustering key.</p>\n<p>A record comprises of a set of columns. The set of columns is repeated in the row for different unique values of <em>(city, buildingID, sensorID, time)</em>. Essentially, a row will contain multiple records. Before composite key was introduced in Cassandra, people had resorted to using this pattern for multi level map by doing string concatenation for column values and names.</p>\n<h2>Primary Key Syntactic Sugar</h2>\n<p>In thrift, the interface to Cassandra is tightly coupled to the internal storage structure.  CQL introduces a layer of abstraction between the underlying storage structure and the logical model and makes the the data model  look like a familiar RDBMS table. The entity in our example has 7 attributes and as shown below, all 7 of them appear as columns in the CQL  table definition.</p>\n<pre>CREATE TABLE buildingControl (\n\tday int,\n\tcity text,\n\tbuildingID int,\n\tsensorID int,\n\ttime timestamp,\n\ttemp double,\n\thumidity double\n\tPRIMARY KEY (day, city, buildingID, sensorID, time)\n);</pre>\n<p>The primary key definition maps to the storage structure as follows. The first element <em>day</em> is the row key or the partitioning key. The remaining 4 elements constitute the clustering key. Internally, a record is stored with  2 physical columns, as we saw in the thrift data model definition. The 7 logical columns map to one row key and two composite columns.</p>\n<h2>Into the Object Land</h2>\n<p>So far in out example, data model had a flat record structure and we were able to define everything nicely with CQL.  What if we have multiple related entities in our use case and we wanted to denormalize the data model. Here is an example of an order object in an eCommerce application, represented with JSON.</p>\n<pre>{\n\t\"custID\" : '12736467',\n\t\"date\" : '2013-06-10',\n\t\"orderID\" : 19482065,\n\t\"amount\" : 216.28,\n\t\"status\" : 'picked',\n\t\"notes\" : 'on time',\n\t\"items\" : [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"sku\" : 87482734,\n\t\t\t\"quantity\" : 4\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"sku\" : 32851042,\n\t\t\t\"quantity\" : 2\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\t\"customer\" : {\n\t\t\"name\" : 'Joe Smith',\n\t\t\"tel\" : '231 456 7890',\n\t\t\"email\" : 'joe@yahoo.com'\n\t}\n}</pre>\n<p>As you can see the the order object contains a child customer object and a list of order line item objects. The embedded customer object is statically defined and we could include it’s attributes  as columns in CQL table definition. However, the embedded list of order line item objects can not be represented in CQL. Because, CQL can handle only list and map of primitives.</p>\n<p>Cassandra is a <em>schema optional</em> data base and you can have any of the following with respect to schema</p>\n<div>\n<ol><li><em>Completely static</em></li>\n<li><em>Completely dynamic</em></li>\n<li><em>Semi static</em></li>\n</ol></div>\n<p>The schema for our example falls into the third category, because we can not define all the fields in the schema.</p>\n<h2>Linearizing Object Hieararchy</h2>\n<p>If we a traverse an arbitrarily nested object, the leaf nodes will contain field name, primitive value pair.  To linearize an object, after the traversing the object hierarchy, a list of leaf node objects is generated. Each such node is saved as a composite column. For nested fields, the column name is generated by concatenating all fields names in the path from the leaf node to the root, separated by period.</p>\n<p>A CQL table along with primary key could be defined comprising of only the statically defined primitive fields of an object.  Here is the partial definition for the order object</p>\n<pre>CREATE TABLE orders (\n    custID text,\n    date text,\n    orderID int,\n    amount double,\n    status text,\n    notes text,\n    PRIMARY KEY (custID,date,orderID)\n);</pre>\n<p>The only advantage of creating the CQL schema, is that you could run CQL select query. However the query will only return the columns defined in the CQL schema, but not the dynamic attributes of the object.</p>\n<h2>Saving the Object</h2>\n<p>The object to be saved in passed to the agiato API as a <em>SimpleDynaBean</em> which is simplified implementation  of apache common <a href=\"http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-beanutils/javadocs/v1.8.3/apidocs/org/apache/commons/beanutils/DynaBean.html\" target=\"_blank\"> <em>DynaBean</em></a> interface. With <em>SimpleDynaBean</em> you could define an arbitrarily nested object. The API also gets passed the  primary key definition.   The different options for object representation are as follows.</p>\n<div>\n<ol><li><em>SimpleDynaBean object</em></li>\n<li><em>JSON string</em></li>\n<li><em>Java bean object</em></li>\n</ol></div>\n<p>The following code snippet uses <em>SimpleDynaBean</em>  and saves the order object in the column family <em>orders</em>.</p>\n<p><em>SimpleDynaBean obj = new  <em>SimpleDynaBean</em>();</em><br /><em> //populate hierarchical object</em><br /><em> ……</em><br /><em> AgiatoContext.initialize(“/home/pranab/Projects/bin/agiato/test.json”);</em><br /><em> ColumnFamilyWriter writer = AgiatoContext.createWriter(“orders”);</em><br /><em>PrimaryKey primKey = new PrimaryKey(“custID”, “date”, “orderID”);<br /><em> writer.writeObject(obj, primKey, ConsistencyLevel.ONE);</em></em></p>\n<p>The object  is traversed in a depth first way and a list leaf nodes is generated. The leaf nodes will include the columns defined in CQL as well as all the dynamic fields.</p>\n<p>The  arguments  in the <em>PrimaryKey</em>  constructor are the primary key column names. Here only the first element constitutes the row key. If that was not the case  you had to call <em>setRowKeyElementCount()</em> to specify how many fields out of the primary key elements constitute  the row key.</p>\n<p>If after the depth first traversal, the primary key fields  appear in the beginning of the list,  you could call another<em> PrimaryKey</em> constructor and pass the number of primary key elements.</p>\n<p>The class <em><a href=\"https://github.com/pranab/agiato/blob/master/src/main/java/agiato/cassandra/data/ObjectSerDes.java\" target=\"_blank\">ObjectSerDes</a></em> hadles object traversal and mapping object fields to composite key columns. Here is the <em><a href=\"https://github.com/pranab/agiato/blob/master/src/main/java/agiato/cassandra/data/DataAccess.java\" target=\"_blank\">DataAccess</a></em> class for Cassandra data access through thrift. From the list of leaf nodes, the row key and the clustering key are identified.  After traversing an object, the flattened list of <i>NamedObject </i> is created as shown below</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><td>row key ObjectNode</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">clustering key ObjectNodes</td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">other ObjectNodes</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><p>The first <em>NamedObject</em> value is converted to a row key. The clustering key <em>NamedObject</em> values makeup the prefix part of the composite key column name.  Then the columns are saved in a way that has the same effect as running a CQL insert query, except that it will store all the dynamic fields of the object, which were not part of the CQL definition.</p>\n<p>Field values are serialized based on introspection of the field data. There is no check made against table meta data. For the fields defined in CQL schema, if data with wrong type is passed in the object,  be prepared to get surprising results from CQL query.</p>\n<h2>Update and Delete</h2>\n<p>For update and delete, it’s necessary to pass a partially formed object, whether a dynamic object or JSON string, to the API, containing the primary key fields and other fields that are going to be updated or deleted. For example, to update the status of an order, it’s necessary for the order object to have the primary key fields and the <em>status</em> field.</p>\n<p>With  statically compiled java bean object,  it’s a difficult to define a  partially formed object. One way of doing it is to have all the fields as primitive wrapper objects, where null will imply absence of a field value.</p>\n<h2>Querying the Object</h2>\n<p>I don’t have the query method to return fully populated object implemented yet. I will be adding it soon. In the mean time we can use CQL and CLI. If we run a CQl query this is what we get. As expected it return only the columns it knows about from the table definition. It does not return any of the dynamic columns.</p>\n<pre> custid   | date       | orderid  | amount | notes   | status\n----------+------------+----------+--------+---------+--------\n 12736467 | 2013-06-10 | 19482065 | 216.28 | in time | picked</pre>\n<p>However, when we run a CLI query it returns every field that is physically stored in Cassandra as below.

Why not serialize all the dynamic fields of the object and store it as a JSON string and include that column as a text filed in CQL create table.  Granted, the column will be visible as a JSON string when you run CQl select query. If you are leaning in that direction, consider the following scenario</p>\n<div>\n<ul><li><em>You want to create secondary index on some nested field e.g., customer.zipCode. The field needs an independent existence as a column </em></li>\n<li><em>You want to treat such nested field  it as dimension in for aggregation and analytic queries involving nested objects</em></li>\n</ul></div>\n<p>The other advantage of having separate column for each nested field, is that CLI query results are more readable.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps</h2>\n<p>My first goal is to support object based query. A prototype object will be passed to agiato. The fields defining the query criteria will need to have the values defined in this object. These fields will be a subset of the primary key fields.</p>\n<p>The API after running the query will return one or more fully populated object. Other fields need not be passed as part of the query object. However, if some prototype value for other fields is passed, then the API will return typed value for the fields, otherwise it will return byte arrays for values.</p>\n<p>My next goal is to support aggregate and analytic queries. The user will define cube schema consisting dimensions and measures pointing to object attributes, including nested attributes. While storing an object aggregate values will be computed and stored in separate column families. Storm will be part of the aggregation engine ecosystem.</p>\n<p>For commercial support for this solution or other solutions in my <a href=\"https://github.com/pranab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">github repositories</a>, please talk to <a href=\"https://thirdeyedata.io/data-science-services-pkghosh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ThirdEye Data Science Services</a>.

To play on Dream11, users create a virtual team of real players, who score points based on their real-life performance in the upcoming match. Our ‘<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Leaderboard</strong>’ feature<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> </strong>enables all our users to see how their team ranks amongst all other competing teams, as their points are updated every minute during every match. The excitement our users feel while watching their chosen players score points for their team with every four, six, wicket, goal, etc. is the core of our entire user experience.</p><p id=\"9281\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Leaderboard generation starts by calculating total points earned by every one of up to 6 teams created by each of our 15 million users. These points are calculated as per the composition of up to 11 players selected from the squad and points scored by the players for every action. These teams are then grouped by the participating contest, sorted by total points and ranked as per competitive ranking to create the Leaderboard for a contest. Leaderboards are updated every minute across thousands of contests for multiple matches being played at the same time.</p><p id=\"910b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The Leaderboard at Dream11 is internally powered by the point calculation engine, code named “<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Aryabhata”</strong> and here’s what it looks like:</p><figure id=\"c743\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*QfYqxzvoIXw6AG8LHUHnwQ.jpeg\" data-width=\"2843\" data-height=\"1452\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*QfYqxzvoIXw6AG8LHUHnwQ.jpeg\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*QfYqxzvoIXw6AG8LHUHnwQ.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" /></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--figure-em\">Pic1: Desktop view of Dream11 Leaderboard</em></figcaption></div></figure><p id=\"b3d7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Dream11 Leaderboard — scale, technology and reliability considerations that influenced our engineering decisions</em></strong></p><p id=\"bb20\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Our Leaderboard has already served 1 million requests per minute, serving 250k concurrent users at its peak. As our user base grows, we expected the request pattern to grow by a much larger magnitude. So, we needed to design a system that would linearly scale as our traffic increases. It should be able to crunch gigabytes of data using distributed sorting within a SLA (Service Level Agreement) of under a minute, while maintaining strong consistency of different user views across multiple platforms. The persistent systems used should support millions of input/output operations per second, while maintaining throughput and latency under the strict SLA desired. <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">This is done to ensure that our users have a seamless experience across platforms and devices at all times.</strong></p><p id=\"e814\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Let’s dive deeper into our system to understand the technical nuances and how we approached them to provide a solution.</p><ol class=\"postList\"><li id=\"c3d9\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--li-em\">Calculating, Sorting, Ranking and Storing data within 1 min SLA using Apache Spark</em></strong></li></ol><p id=\"0909\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Apache Spark is a fast, distributed, in-memory highly scalable cluster computing framework. It provides support for low level java APIs as well as sql, for processing large amount of data within sub second latency. We leverage Spark for calculating, sorting and ranking of our data. So far, we’ve been able to use Spark to process Leaderboards of around a million contests, ranging from 2 teams to 400,000 teams in different contests for a single match, totalling up to <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">40 million records within our 60-second SLA</strong>.</p><p id=\"7ca6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The point calculation engine loads data for all contests in Apache Spark’s memory which is distributed across the cluster machines, allowing us to scale up simply by adding more nodes to the Spark cluster. The distributed contest data is then processed concurrently to calculate new points for every participating user team. Once the new user team points are prepared, they are grouped by contest, sorted and ranked as per competitive ranking, thereby completing the generation of the new Leaderboard state. <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">By deploying Spark at a large scale for all our calculations, we make sure our users don’t miss a thing with the fastest of real-time updates at lightening speed.</strong></p><p id=\"4beb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">2.<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> Providing consistent views to users using Data Isolation and Snapshots</em></strong></p><p id=\"bb45\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The contests that a user has joined and the Leaderboard for each of those contests is displayed in different view parts on the product (refer to the image above). The user can browse this data and also access the points/ranks/teams of other users participating in the same contest as him, once the deadline (1 hour prior to the start of match) hits. Every view needs to be consistent when points and Leaderboard are updated in the background. For eg: If our Leaderboard for a contest shows results for calculations done at an event (eg. 1st ball of over), our team view should also show our users their team points of the same calculation event, so that the displayed points are the same.</p><p id=\"02a9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The point calculation engine concludes by updating every contest record in worst case scenario. If we fetch data from the same source that is being simultaneously updated, the breadth of the update operation will result in inevitable view inconsistency. Moreover, since all the updates are live to the user, rollbacks damage user trust and provides a bad user experience. Therefore, we need to isolate read and write operations at the data level. Snapshot Isolation in transactional system provides a way to manage concurrency by isolating data at which they operate, generally implemented by MVCC [multi version concurrency control]. Operating with multiple version of data helps to isolate concurrent operation and maintain consistency of database.</p><p id=\"f63c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The point calculation engine extends the above idea and snapshots every write action resulting in immutable data set. This insert-only behavior and immutability allows concurrent processing of multiple game events which we can tag linearly to allow easy rollbacks. The user view can now be tagged to a snapshot version thereby achieving consistency across all user view, even when new snapshot is in process.</p><p id=\"de57\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">3.<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> Guaranteeing atomicity of Bulk Write/Calculation using Apache Spark</em></strong></p><p id=\"3e58\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Apache Spark provides fault tolerance out of the box. In case of failures in cluster machines, jobs are rescheduled on other available cluster machines. If rescheduling fails for certain attempts, Spark fails the whole job and shuts down the entire process. As long as your process is idempotent, such a feature allows building atomic bulk operation by retrying failed events to completion.</p><p id=\"fbe0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The point calculation engine leverages this fault tolerant property of Spark and solves atomic bulk write problem by moving away from UPDATE to INSERT IF NOT EXISTS operation. Since we only perform insert operations, multiple inserts would only result in the same output thereby achieving idempotency in the system.</p><p id=\"8601\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">4.<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> Implementing bulk Write/Read With Horizontal Scaling and HA using Apache Cassandra</em></strong></p><p id=\"8201\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Based on the requirements of the point calculation engine we needed to choose a persistent system with the following properties:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li id=\"4550\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Highly available and capable of handling loss of a few nodes</li><li id=\"bc5e\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Tunable consistency</li><li id=\"e39d\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Easy to scale up and down based on need</li><li id=\"7ce7\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Multi-Master to serve the traffic at the rate desired, which would be difficult in a master-slave setup due to replication lag</li><li id=\"9d59\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Optimized for very high write throughput</li><li id=\"7bde\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Strong community support</li></ul><p id=\"9e0c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Apache Cassandra is a distributed, fault tolerant and highly available system that is specifically designed to handle huge amount of data. Primary features of Apache Cassandra includes decentralized architecture with no single point of failure, high availability with replication within cluster while performing write operation. This is in contrast to a master-slave system, where data is written to master and propagated to slave via binary logs which adds to replica lag. Apache Cassandra supports tunable consistency and has a strong community support.</p><p id=\"e1d2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Dream11 Leaderboard is supported by a 10 node (c4.8x large Amazon ec2 instances) Cassandra cluster which has supported 5 Million read/write CPM (calls per minute) at peak.</p><p id=\"7bd3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">5.<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> Supporting Flash Read and other Read optimizations using Redis as a local cache</em></strong></p><p id=\"fb6a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Our Leaderboard use case demands bulk atomic writes as well as reads with very high throughput. It is also a well-known fact that Cassandra performs optimally best for pointed queries, i.e. queries with filter clause that identify partition and data residence efficiently. Hence, we needed to design the Data Model in such a way where both Bulk Writes and High Reads demands can be fulfilled to scale. We designed several views which were written by Spark jobs directly into Cassandra. The read queries to Cassandra directly fetched data from respective views with pointed queries and thus, became highly scaled.</p><p id=\"fa3c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Also, since the Leaderboard data mutates every 60 seconds, we analyzed that a caching layer in the middle would further optimize reads. One possible option was to add a centralized Redis cluster. We had run into some issues at scale with this approach in the past because of hot/cold zones. Due to this, we ended up having to deploy a lot more nodes than needed. We also realized that since our point calculation data is immutable, it can be cached in a distributed fashion (Local redis at Web Server end) removing the need of a central redis cluster service thereby eliminating one more point of failure/bottleneck in the system. It can flush data every time a new event arrives and can achieve a low cache size. Running local redis servers proved to improve both latency and system availability since it reduces read load on Cassandra.</p><p id=\"2b4b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">The Final Aryabhata Architecture</strong></p><p id=\"dbd7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The image below shows our full Leaderboard architecture:</p><figure id=\"a61a\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*G3QgtcauLu_mRgKuZqpmyA.jpeg\" data-width=\"3322\" data-height=\"3231\" data-is-featured=\"true\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*G3QgtcauLu_mRgKuZqpmyA.jpeg\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*G3QgtcauLu_mRgKuZqpmyA.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" /></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--figure-em\">Pic2: Aryabhata final architecture</em></figcaption></div></figure><ol class=\"postList\"><li id=\"3a9a\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--figure\">Dream11 API is an edge service that serves all requests</li><li id=\"08ad\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Resources consumed and created are saved to mysql database</li><li id=\"88f1\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">After match deadline, data is fetched from mysql to s3 via Amazon Data pipeline</li><li id=\"235a\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Data Pipeline saves all contest related information to s3</li><li id=\"65e3\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Data pipeline sends an SNS notification on completion of data transfer</li><li id=\"c3a2\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">SNS triggers a lambda function which makes an api call to Leaderboard api</li><li id=\"ff8d\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Leaderboard service schedules data loading spark job on spark cluster using Spark Job Server.</li><li id=\"a86c\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Spark reads contest data from S3 and saves it to cassandra after processing.

It stores every mutation result and also supports real time queries. Although Cassandra is designed for no single point of failure; huge read/write loads sometimes limit throughput from a single partition. A simple solution to the problem could be separation of read and write. Cassandra supports multiple strategies for maintaining replication across two ring clusters. In the above strategy, one ring could only accept write, while reads could be served from the other ring. We would like to explore this strategy after conducting some experiments with consistency and latency.</p><p id=\"ce49\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">2.<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> Personalising Journey Graphs</em></strong></p><p id=\"62e8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Leaderboard service persists every version of the Leaderboard state, each being a representation of a corresponding real world event. We can use this data to create a feature displaying a journey graph for a user for a particular match. Journey Graphs would be just personification of how user ranks travelled during game events. This will enable users to see a trend of their ranks during/after the match, adding transparency and help build trust.</p><p id=\"03a2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">3.<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> Enhancing our Event Generation Model</em></strong></p><p id=\"5f9f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Currently, the Leaderboard api works in pull mode where the clients constantly keep polling for new events to fetch latest data. To reduce latency and enhance user experience in the future, we would like to implement a push model. In this model, the Leaderboard service pushes events to client notifying new score update, greatly reducing the time between an actual event and corresponding update of points in the frontend. This will enable the view on the frontend to be auto-refreshed as soon as the new data is ready.</p><p id=\"961c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">4.<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> Optimising Data Mining Processes</em></strong></p><p id=\"9203\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Data is the new gold and with Leaderboard architecture, we generate huge dataset that provides great insight about the match as well as user behaviour.

The resulting system should be linearly scalable, and it should scale out rather than up.</p><p>Here’s how it looks like, from a high-level perspective:</p><p><img src=\"https://skyhenryk.github.io/images/lambda-architecture/1/lamdbda-architecture.png\" alt=\"LA screenshot\" /></p><p>The Lambda Architecture (cred. http://lambda-architecture.net/)</p><h2 id=\"lambda-architecture-example\">Lambda Architecture Example</h2><p><img src=\"https://skyhenryk.github.io/images/lambda-architecture/1.png\" alt=\"LA screenshot\" /></p><p><strong>lambda architecture example (LAE)</strong></p><p>Let’s build lambda architecture example (LAE) one by one with introduction and codes.</p><p>The most diffrent thing is that I put buffering layer for this example lambda architecture.</p><p>If the log data goes from api server to S3 or spark-streaming directly, it needs a long time to wait to send a data\nbecause I assume that there are <strong>quite many API server to send a log at the same time</strong> and threads of aws-cli(to send a data to s3) and spark-streaming are limited\nSo I will use kafka - distributed replicated cluster messaging system.

We present here benchmarking results for some typical IoT query cases we were experiencing in the design of ORION, our IoT platform. The aim is to understand when, and perhaps more importantly, how Cassandra can play an important role for this important use case.</em></p><p><em>Authors: </em>Arbab Khalil, Affan Syed</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>At AN10, we are developing an entire Internet of Things ecosystem, building the entire value chain of IoT products and services: from intelligent sensors and gateways at the edge, to our industrial IoT platform ORION, to high-performance applications and solution suites for specific industries.</p><p>The core of our entire product &amp; service offering is ORION, a Big Data capable, highly scalable and full-featured IoT platform. An IoT platform provides the capabilities of IoT device management, scalable data management &amp; analytics, and robust APIs on top. The idea is for the platform to do the heavy lifting, and provide applications with IoT capabilities through API calls. Building this platform has required reviewing, testing, and adapting quite a few data stacks, tools and technologies. As an open company, we want to share our experiences with using these technologies as part of a series of blogs. These will take the form of an evidence-based article, showing real-world results.</p><h2>The data-analytics stack for ORION</h2><p>One of the basic functions of an IoT platform is that it  meant to scale and receive data from million of devices every minute.  As such, we decided to stick with using a big data stack that matches, at the first cut,  our need to scale: thus we went with the SMACK (Spark, Mesos, Akka, Cassandra, Kafka) stack [1].  To summarize this stack, it allows horizontal scalability in every aspect of a Big Data stack. Cassandra scales the big data storage at high write speeds, Spark provides a distributed analytic engine, Mesos provides the cluster and resource monitoring and management capability, while Kafka and Akka enable a queue-based microservices architecture to build features around a real-time data pipeline.</p><p>We use  Cassandra, where the table schema has to be optimized (denormalized) for the type of queries we expect the platform to execute. This is a well known tradeoff (footnote: while there are a host of wonderful articles about how to build schema in Cassandra for IoT, this article is not it), but we wanted to better evaluate the different schema models for the type of queries, generally, we expect our platform to handle.</p><blockquote class=\"\"><h5 class=\"blockquote-text\">we wanted to better evaluate the different schema models for the type of queries, generally, we expect our platform to handle.</h5></blockquote><h3>A generic IoT query</h3><p>IoT application have a general nature where devices report sensor data on regular intervals (as well as irregular events, but we will leave those aside for the current discussion). This sampling rate implies a time-series data which demands windowed queries; however, IoT applications have another topological mapping that requires queries to range over a group of devices (lets assume uniquely identified by a device id) — this can for region specific or collocation related analysis.</p><p>Thus, typically, while the need to look at real-time data can be separated per device, analytical queries will demand queries that range over both time and device ids . This is the generic query we were experiencing being demanded by our customers in the IoT domain.</p><p>While using several best-practices for time-series schema design in Cassandra, there are a few other constraints that crop up that make no particular schema design a clear winner, and require detailed benchmarking (thus this effort). One such is the issue of ensuring that partition sizes are not exceptionally large, so we need a way to have a deterministic break down on a size, e.g. monthly basis. Another, concern is the issue of partitioning such that all data does not go to a single partition at the same time (e.g. hotspots due to partition key having ONLY date).  These all make the denormalization of data for Cassandra difficult, especially for the case where the range over devices and time cannot be restricted, either.</p><p>In order to evaluate, we came up with a few schema configurations, where we majorly change the PRIMARY_KEY (determining the performance of queries). We consider a simple device with a packet containing the dev_id, date and timestamp for a  single voltage sensor (different sensors will have different tables for now, we can also keep them in one, but again a distraction from the current evaluation).</p><div><pre>#### C* table1 ####</pre><pre>CREATE TABLE test_timeseries.timeseries_with_date1 (</pre><pre>    dev_id text,</pre><pre>    day date,</pre><pre>    rec_time timestamp,</pre><pre>    voltage float,</pre><pre>    <code>PRIMARY KEY ((dev_id, rec_time), day)</code></pre><pre>) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (day ASC)</pre><pre>#### C* table2 ####</pre><pre>CREATE TABLE test_timeseries.timeseries_with_date2 (</pre><pre>    dev_id text,</pre><pre>    day date,</pre><pre>    rec_time timestamp,</pre><pre>    voltage float,</pre><pre>    <code>PRIMARY KEY (dev_id, day, rec_time)</code></pre><pre>) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (day ASC, rec_time ASC)</pre><pre>#### C* table3 ####</pre><pre>CREATE TABLE test_timeseries.timeseries_with_date3 (</pre><pre>    day date,</pre><pre>    dev_id text,</pre><pre>    rec_time timestamp,</pre><pre>    voltage float,</pre><pre>    <code>PRIMARY KEY (day, dev_id, rec_time)</code></pre><pre>) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (dev_id ASC, rec_time ASC)</pre><pre>#### C* table4 ####</pre><pre>CREATE TABLE test_timeseries.timeseries_with_date4 (</pre><pre>    day date,</pre><pre>    dev_id text,</pre><pre>    rec_time timestamp,</pre><pre>    voltage float,</pre><pre>   <code> PRIMARY KEY ((day, dev_id), rec_time)</code></pre><pre>) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (rec_time ASC)</pre><pre>#### C* table5 ####</pre><pre>CREATE TABLE test_timeseries.timeseries_with_date5 (</pre><pre>    dev_id text,</pre><pre>    day date,</pre><pre>    rec_time timestamp,</pre><pre>    voltage float,</pre><pre>    <code>PRIMARY KEY ((dev_id, day), rec_time)</code></pre><p><code>) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (rec_time ASC)</code></p></div><h2>Evaluation Framework:</h2><p>We are using a virtual machine with 8 vCPUs and 30 GB memory running Ubuntu Server 16.04. Both Cassandra and Spark are running on same machine with single node deployment. We are using Cassandra:3.11.2, Spark 2.2.0 and Spark-Cassandra-Connector:2.0.7-s_2.11 version.  We use Spark to enable any query optimization possible using its Catalyst engine.</p><h3>Testing Procedure</h3><p>Data-set contains data from 1000 devices, each sending one packet per minute over a total duration of two months (July and Aug 2017) or 62 days. Each table contains 89.28 million entries.</p><p>Initially we benchmarked these 5 tables with three different querying methods available in Spark. We ran a simple count query on each table for different number of devices over variable time duration in days.  We will discuss each method one by one:</p><p>1. where() function of DataFrame API: Conditions on day and dev_id are given through where() function followed by cunt() function on dataframe. This query is performed as follows:</p><div><pre>### Loading Table from Cassandra ###</pre><pre>table1_df = spark.read.format(\"org.apache.spark.sql.cassandra\")\\</pre><pre>    .options(keyspace = 'test_timeseries', table = 'timeseries_with_date').load()</pre><pre>#### Querying table ####</pre><pre>query_table1_df = table1_df.where((col(\"day\") &gt;= \"2017-07-01\") &amp; (col(\"day\") &lt;= \"2017-07-04\") &amp; \\</pre><pre>    (col(\"dev_id\").isin(devices))).count()</pre></div><p>2. Spark SQL Query using range queries: Here we are running queries using Spark SQL API and gives duration through range. It makes writing queries simple and improves code readability. This query is performed as follows:</p><div><pre>#### Loading Table from Cassandra and Registering Temp View ####</pre><pre>spark.read.format(\"org.apache.spark.sql.cassandra\")\\</pre><pre>    .options(keyspace = 'test_timeseries', table = 'timeseries_with_date')\\</pre><pre>    .load().createOrReplaceTempView(\"table1\")</pre><pre>#### Querying table where <code>devices </code><code>is a string having list of all dev_id's ####</code></pre><pre>query_table1 = spark.sql(\"SELECT COUNT(1) FROM table1 WHERE day &gt;= cast('2017-07-01' as date) AND \\</pre><pre>day &lt;= cast('2017-07-15' as date) AND dev_id  IN(\" + devices + \")\" </pre></div><p>3. Spark SQL Query using IN() : Here we are running queries using Spark SQL API and giving dates as list through IN(). This is to check weather range performs better or passing days through IN(). This query is performed as follows:</p><div><pre>query1 = \"SELECT COUNT(1) FROM table1 WHERE day IN \" + dates + \" AND dev_id  IN \" + devices</pre><pre>## <code>dates</code><code> is string containing all days and </code><code>devices</code><code> is string containing all dev_id's</code></pre><pre>query_table1 = spark.sql(query1)</pre></div><p>Results of these queries are shown in Without Year sheet in results sections. Time format is minutes:seconds.milliseconds (MM:SS.sss)</p><h3>Adding another field for performance</h3><p>After reading  Jon Haddad’s article [2] about “Cassandra Time Series Data Modeling For Massive Scale”, we added an extra field of year in partition keys of above four PRIMARY KEYs. Our new dataset contains data from 1000 devices, corresponding to sending one packet per minute over a total duration of four months (Nov 2017 to Feb 2018) or 120 days, thus ensuring two different partitions due to years. Now we have four additional  tables with the same schema but different primary keys:</p><ol><li>    PRIMARY KEY ((year, dev_id), day, rec_time)</li><li>    PRIMARY KEY ((year, day), dev_id, rec_time)</li><li>    PRIMARY KEY ((year, dev_id, day), rec_time)</li><li>    PRIMARY KEY ((year, day, dev_id), rec_time)</li></ol><h2>Results:</h2><p>We performed our experiments and the results were compiled in a publicly visible <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kk6Sgm_sfB34m8oKEOxspcwtZxxM_xwqmCQT6sT8H-Y/edit#gid=0\">sheet</a> shared here [6]. While we encourage the reader to look at it in details, here we replicate one table of the sheet for quick analysis.</p><table dir=\"ltr\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-spacing:

behavior of each PRIMARY KEY with respect to query time and its effect on C* cluster.</p><ol><li>PRIMARY KEY ((dev_id, rec_time), day) :  Our queries are based on day and dev id not on rec_time, so having rec_time before day proved to be a worst case in most of cases.</li><li>PRIMARY KEY (dev_id, day, rec_time) : It seems to be the best case in terms of execution time in both range queries and IN() queries. This has a major problem of large partition size because all data of one device is stored in single partition.</li><li>PRIMARY KEY (day, dev_id, rec_time) : With range queries it didn’t performed well but with IN() queries the execution time is directly proportional to number of days irrespective of number of devices. This has problem of hotspot in C* cluster as single partition contains data of whole day which also results in large partition size.</li><li>PRIMARY KEY ((day, dev_id), rec_time) : The execution time is directly proportional to total table size, almost same for different number of days and number of devices. Although it solves the problem of large partitions and hotspot in C* cluster.</li><li>PRIMARY KEY ((dev_id, day), rec_time) : Its behaviour is almost similar to 4th one.</li><li>PRIMARY KEY ((year, dev_id), day, rec_time) : It is good for lower number of devices but worst cast for higher number of devices. It somehow tries to solve the problem of all data of single device in one partition as it created a partition over year and device id.</li><li>PRIMARY KEY ((year, day), dev_id, rec_time) : The execution time only depends on number of days only, irrespective of number of devices being queried but it is never the worst case. Moreover it has same hotspot issue as mentioned in 2nd PRIMARY KEY.</li><li>PRIMARY KEY ((year, dev_id, day), rec_time) : Its behavior is also to 4th PRIMARY KEY. Moreover adding year field just adds an additional cost as date is already there.</li><li>PRIMARY KEY ((year, day, dev_id), rec_time) : Its behavior is similar to 8th PRIMARY KEY.</li></ol><h3>Other Observations:</h3><p>We observed that having a multi-field partition key allows for fast querying only if the “=” is used going left to right. If an IN() (for specifying eg. range of time or list of devices) is used once that order, than any further usage of IN() removes any benefit (i.e. a near full table scan).</p><p>Another useful observation was that using the IN() to query for days is less useful than putting in a range query.</p><h2>Conclusion:</h2><blockquote class=\"\"><h5 class=\"blockquote-text\">As such, it seems that using Cassandra for serving OLTP and OLAP queries for an IoT use-case is not, perhaps, the best decision. This requires us to know combine Cassandra's industry strength robustness and performance, with another DB that enables fast queries for the typical IoT use case.</h5></blockquote><p>The main takeaways from this benchmarking is that we don’t have a single schema to answer our (IoT) use case without any drawbacks. Thus while the ((day, dev_id), rec_time) gives a constant response, it is dependent entirely on the total data size (full scan). On the other hand, (dev_id, day, rec_time) and its counterpart (day, dev_id, rec_time) provide acceptable results, we have the issue of very large partition space in the first, and hotspot while writing for the latter case.</p><p>As such, it seems that using Cassandra for serving OLTP and OLAP queries for an IoT use-case is not, perhaps, the best decision. This requires us to know combine Cassandra’s industry strength robustness and performance, with another DB that enables fast queries for the typical IoT use case. We are currently evaluating Druid [3], InfluxDB [4], and Kudu [5]  as companion database in this regard. We will keep everyone posted about the final decision and performance results.</p><h4><strong>About Authors</strong></h4><p><em>Arbab is Design Engineer at AN10. akhalil@an10.io<br /></em><em>Affan Syed is Head of Engineering at AN10. <strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/affan-ahmed-syed/\">LinkedIn</a></strong></em></p><h3>References[1] <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-smack-stack\">https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-smack-stack</a>[2] <a href=\"http://thelastpickle.com/blog/2017/08/02/time-series-data-modeling-massive-scale.html\">http://thelastpickle.com/blog/2017/08/02/time-series-data-modeling-massive-scale.html</a>[3] <a href=\"http://druid.io/\">http://druid.io/</a>[4] <a href=\"https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/\">https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/</a>[5] <a href=\"https://kudu.apache.org/\">https://kudu.apache.org/</a>[6] <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kk6Sgm_sfB34m8oKEOxspcwtZxxM_xwqmCQT6sT8H-Y/edit#gid=0\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kk6Sgm_sfB34m8oKEOxspcwtZxxM_xwqmCQT6sT8H-Y/edit#gid=0</a></h3>",

(Product.class).  (Next blog post, I'll show how to do this dynamically)</p>\n<p> You can prime the pump with a:</p>\n<div>\n <pre lang=\"text/x-java\">System.out.println(\"Total Records = [\" + productsRDD.count() + \"]\");</pre>\n <br /></div>\n<p> The count operation forces Spark to load the data into memory, which makes queries like the following lightning fast:</p>\n<div>\n <pre lang=\"text/x-java\">JavaSchemaRDD result = sqlContext.sql(\"SELECT id from products WHERE price &lt; 0.50\");\nfor (Row row : result.collect()){\n  System.out.println(row);\n}</pre>\n</div>\n<p> That's it.  You're off to the SQL races.</p>\n<div>\n <div>\n  <p> <em>P.S.  If you try querying the sqlContext without applying a schema and/or without registering the RDD as a table, you may see something similar to this:</em></p>\n  <pre lang=\"text/x-java\">Exception in thread \"main\" org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.errors.package$TreeNodeException: Unresolved attributes: 'id, tree:\n'Project ['id]\n 'Filter ('price &lt; 0.5)\n  NoRelation$\n</pre>\n </div>\n</div></div><div class=\"content-html\" itemprop=\"text\"><a>\n                        <img class=\"pub-image\" width=\"420\" itemprop=\"image\" src=\"src\" alt=\"image\" /></a></div>",

The Cassandra connector <a href=\"https://github.com/datastax/spark-cassandra-connector/#documentation\">docs</a> cover the basic usage pretty well. Aside from the bazillion different versions of the connector getting everything up and running is fairly straightforward.</p>\n<p>Start the spark shell with the necessary Cassandra connector dependencies <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">bin/spark-shell --packages datastax:spark-cassandra-connector:1.6.0-M2-s_2.10</code>.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"language-scala\" data-lang=\"scala\">1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n</pre><pre>import org.apache.spark.{SparkConf, SparkContext}\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.SQLContext\nimport com.datastax.spark.connector._\n# connect to a local cassandra instance\nval conf = new SparkConf(true)\n    .set(\"spark.cassandra.connection.host\", \"127.0.0.1\")\nval sc = new SparkContext(conf)\nval sqlContext = new SQLContext(sc)\n# read in some data as a DataFrame\nval df = sqlContext\n    .read\n    .format(\"org.apache.spark.sql.cassandra\")\n    .options(Map(\"table\" -&gt; \"fooTable\", \"keyspace\" -&gt; \"bar\")).load.cache()</pre></figure><p>Lovely, you now have a DataFrame that acts just like any other <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">spark</code> DataFrame. So far so good. Now let’s say you wanted to test something in the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">spark-shell</code> and pull in data from Cassandra. No problem, just do what you did before, except that you need to stop the existing <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">SparkContext</code> that is created automagically when the shell starts up, before you can create a new one. This isn’t really documented anywhere, except sporadically on <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25837436/how-to-load-spark-cassandra-connector-in-the-shell\">StackOverflow</a>.

Instead of calling <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">sc.stop</code> and then recreating the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">conf</code> with the Cassandra host details added, just add the Cassandra host details to the configuration defaults in <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf</code>.

I have found many times,that many who use this,do not know about some important points of Cassandra that makes it different from SQL databases like Postgres. Same is the case for operations team, there are some aspects related to storage, GC settings , that many are not aware of. I am not an expert in Cassandra internals and don’t aspire to be if I can avoid it.This is mostly a note to myself, and something which I can ask others to refer to instead of repeating over email a gazillion times. There are lot of other parts like repair etc which I have left out.

In Cassandra ,however consistency is configurable. This means that with some write and read speed sacrifice, you can have strong consistency as well as high availability. Cassandra can be used for small data as well as big data; depending on your use case you can tune the consistency per key-space or even per-operation.</p><blockquote id=\"86c1\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><div>Cassandra values Availability and Partitioning tolerance (AP).

Application level sharding means that the logic of partitioning data across multiple node is done at the application level. That is based on some key- classic example — East Coast vs West Coast or <a href=\"http://www.malinga.me/application-aware-sharding-for-a-mysql-database/\" data-href=\"http://www.malinga.me/application-aware-sharding-for-a-mysql-database/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">similar</a>; your DB write code will select a Database to connect , write and read. The problem is that the complexity of application level sharding quickly gets complex and it is not a good way to scale . Cassandra and most NoSQL databases does sharding transparently (as you have seen via the partition key). This is a pretty big advantage as without this horizontal scaling is a hard problem.</p><h4 id=\"db8e\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Open-Source and Commercial</h4><p id=\"a666\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">As of the time of writing this, relations between Apache Foundation and Datastax- which was one of the largest contributor to Cassandra ? have soured. There is an commercial version of Cassandra — Datastax Enterprise Edition and open source version is the Apache Cassandra. The Java driver of Cassandra has two version, the open source and DSE provided, and you cannot use commercial driver with open source Cassandra.

        "url": "https://www.gridgain.com/resources/blog/apache-cassandra-vs-apache-ignite-affinity-collocation-and-distributed-sql",
        "content": "<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.gridgain.com/resources/blog/apache-cassandra-or-apache-ignite-thoughts-simplified-architecture\" target=\"_blank\">previous article</a>, we reviewed and summarized pitfalls of the query-driven data modeling methodology (a.k.a. denormalized data modeling) utilized in Apache Cassandra. Turns out that the methodology prevents us from developing efficient applications without insight into what our <strong>queries</strong> will be like. In reality, an application architecture under this scenario will get more complicated, less maintainable and prone to notable data duplication.</p><p>Furthermore, it was discovered that the pitfalls are usually shielded with statements like <em>\"if you really want to be scalable, fast and highly-available then be ready to store duplicated data and sacrifice SQL along with strong consistency.\"</em> That might have been true a decade ago but it's a total fable nowadays!</p><p>Not going too far, we picked another Apache Software Foundation citizen -- <a href=\"https://ignite.apache.org\">Apache Ignite</a> -- and in this article will figure out how our Ignite based application's architecture would look like and what would be its maintenance costs.</p><p>The application of our choice tracks all the cars produced by a vendor and gives insights on production power for every single vendor. If you recall, it has the following relational model:</p><img alt=\"Cars and Vendors\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"06c8fa2e-626c-4b3b-a63a-9c359a453754\" src=\"https://www.gridgain.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/cars_vendors.png\" class=\"align-center\" /><p>Can we just go ahead and create those 3 tables in Ignite with the <a href=\"https://apacheignite-sql.readme.io/docs/create-table\" target=\"_blank\">CREATE TABLE</a> command and run our SQL-driven application immediately? Depends... If we were not supposed to join the data stored in different tables then it would be enough. But in the previous article, we put a requirement that the application has to support 2 queries that require JOINs:</p><ul><li><strong>Q1: get car models produced by a vendor within a particular time frame (newest first).</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Q2: get a number of cars of a specific model produced by a vendor.</strong></li>\n</ul><p>In the Cassandra case, we got away with JOINs by creating 2 tables for each of the queries. Do we go through the same experience with Ignite? Totally not. In fact, Ignite's <a href=\"https://apacheignite-sql.readme.io/docs/distributed-joins#non-collocated-joins\" target=\"_blank\">non-collocated JOINs</a> are already at our service and doesn't require anything else from us once the 3 tables are created. However, they are not as efficient and fast as their <a href=\"https://apacheignite-sql.readme.io/docs/distributed-joins#section-collocated-joins\" target=\"_blank\">collocated</a> counter-part. Therefore, let's learn more about <a href=\"https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/affinity-collocation\" target=\"_blank\">affinity collocation</a> first and see how this concept is used in modern databases such as Apache Ignite.</p><p>Affinity collocation is a powerful concept of Ignite (and other distributed databases such as Google Spanner or MemSQL) that allows storing <strong>related</strong> data on the same cluster nodes. How do we know which data is related? It's simple, especially with the background of relational databases --  just identify a parent-child relationship between your business objects, specify <a href=\"https://apacheignite-sql.readme.io/docs/create-table\" target=\"_blank\">affinity keys in CREATE TABLE statements</a> and your job is done because Ignite will take care of the rest!</p><p>Taking the Cars and Vendors application as an example, it's reasonable to use Vendor as a parent entity and Car with Production as its children. For instance, once this happens and the affinity keys are set, all the Cars produced by specific Vendor will be stored on the same node like it's shown in the picture below:</p><img alt=\"Affinity Collocation\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"1a2bfb95-f25e-4282-bdf5-44e6ea6c9d84\" src=\"https://www.gridgain.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/affinity_collocation.png\" class=\"align-center\" /><p>Specifically, the picture shows that all the Cars produced by Toyota are stored on Ignite node 1 while the Cars produced by Ford Motors are stored on Ignite node 2. This is the affinity collocation in action -- Cars are stored on a node where an entry of a respective Vendor is.</p><p>It's time to define SQL tables to achieve such data distribution. Let's start with Vendor table:</p><pre class=\"language-java\">\nCREATE TABLE Vendor (\n    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    name VARCHAR,\n    address VARCHAR\n);\n</pre><p>The Vendors will be distributed randomly across the cluster nodes. Ignite uses the primary key column to calculate a node that will own a Vendor's entry (refer to the recording of <a href=\"https://www.gridgain.com/resources/webinars/in-memory-computing-essentials-architects-and-developers-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">Ignite essentials Part 1</a> webinar for more details).</p><p>The Car table goes next:</p><pre class=\"language-java\">\nCREATE TABLE Car (\n    id INT,\n    vendor_id INT,\n    model VARCHAR,\n    year INT,\n    price float,\n    PRIMARY KEY(id, vendor_id)\n) WITH \"affinityKey=vendor_id\";\n</pre><p>The table for Cars has <code class=\"language-java\">affinityKey</code> parameter set to <code class=\"language-java\">vendor_id</code> column. This key instructs Ignite to store a Car on the cluster node of its <code class=\"language-java\">vendor_id</code> (refer to the recording of <a href=\"https://www.gridgain.com/resources/webinars/in-memory-computing-essentials-architects-and-developers-part-2\" target=\"_blank\">Ignite essentials Part 2</a> webinar for more info).</p><p>Repeating the same procedure for Production table which entries will be stored on the cluster nodes identified by <code class=\"language-java\">vendor_id</code> as well:</p><pre class=\"language-java\">\nCREATE TABLE Production (\n    id INT,\n    car_id INT,\n    vendor_id INT,\n    country VARCHAR,\n    total INT,\n    year INT,\n    PRIMARY KEY(id, car_id, vendor_id)\n) WITH \"affinityKey=vendor_id\";\n</pre><p>That's it with the data modeling done right in Apache Ignite. The next step is to get down to our application code and make out all the required queries.</p><p>Ignite cluster can be queried with our old-good-friend SQL that supports distributed JOINs and secondary indexes. </p><p>There are two types of JOINs in Ignite -- <a href=\"https://apacheignite-sql.readme.io/docs/distributed-joins#section-collocated-joins\" target=\"_blank\">collocated</a> and <a href=\"https://apacheignite-sql.readme.io/docs/distributed-joins#section-non-collocated-joins\" target=\"_blank\">non-collocated</a>. The collocated JOINs omit data (that is needed to complete a JOIN) movement between cluster nodes expecting that the tables, that are being joined, are already collocated and all the data is available locally. That's the most efficient and performant JOINs you can get in distributed databases such as Ignite. The non-collocated JOINs as the name suggests is our a backup plan if there was no way to achieve affinity collocation for some tables but they still need to be joined. This type of JOINs is slower because they might involve data movement between cluster nodes at a JOIN time.</p><p>Previously we could collocate Vendor, Car and Production tables and now can benefit from the collocated JOINs preparing an SQL query for <strong>Q1 </strong>(<em>get car models produced by a vendor within a particular time frame (newest first</em>)):</p><pre class=\"language-java\">\nSELECT c.model, p.country, p.total, p.year FROM Vendor as v\nJOIN Production as p ON v.id = p.vendor_id\nJOIN Car as c ON c.id = p.car_id\nWHERE v.name = 'Ford Motor' and p.year &gt;= 2017\nORDER BY p.year;\n</pre><p>Is there any way to make it even faster? Sure, let's define secondary indexes for <code class=\"language-java\">Vendor.name</code> and <code class=\"language-java\">Production.year</code> columns:</p><pre class=\"language-java\">\nCREATE INDEX vendor_name_id ON Vendor (name);\nCREATE INDEX prod_year_id ON Production (year);\n</pre><p>The SQL query for required <strong>Q2</strong> (<em>get a number of cars of a specific model produced by a vendor</em>) does not require extra efforts from us:</p><pre class=\"language-java\">\nSELECT p.country, p.total, p.year FROM Vendor as v\nJOIN Production as p ON v.id = p.vendor_id\nJOIN Car as c ON c.id = p.car_id\nWHERE v.name = 'Ford Motor' and c.model = 'Explorer';\n</pre><p>Now, whenever a boss stops by our cubicle requesting to add a new feature we can quickly come up with a set of new SQL queries needed for it, configure secondary indexes and go to the kitchen to chat with teammates. Job done! In comparison, recall what it took us to support new query <strong>Q2 </strong> for the <a href=\"https://www.gridgain.com/resources/blog/apache-cassandra-or-apache-ignite-thoughts-simplified-architecture\" target=\"_blank\">Cassandra based architecture</a>.</p><p>Affinity collocation based on data modeling in Ignite has the following advantages over the query-driven denormalized modeling in Cassandra:</p><ul><li>Applications data layer is modeled in a familiar relational way and easy to maintain.</li>\n<li>Data is accessed using standard SQL syntax.</li>\n<li>Affinity collocation provides more benefits from modern distributed databases:\n<ul><li>Efficient and highly performant distributed JOINs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ignite.apache.org/collocatedprocessing.html\" target=\"_blank\">Collocated computations</a></li>\n<li>Watch a recording of this <a href=\"https://www.gridgain.com/resources/webinars/scale-out-and-conquer-architectural-decisions-behind-distributed-in-memory\" target=\"_blank\">webinar</a> to reveal more benefits of this technique.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul><p>The simplified software architecture we get with Ignite is not the only benefit if we consider it instead of Cassandra. Give me a couple of weeks to put together my thoughts on strong consistency and in-memory performance.</p>",

Learn more about it in this Microsoft Mechanics video with Principal Engineering Manager Kirill Gavrylyuk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-benefit-of-using-apache-cassandra-api-for-azure-cosmos-db\">What is the benefit of using Apache Cassandra API for Azure Cosmos DB?</h2>\n<p><strong>No operations management</strong>: As a true fully managed service, Azure Cosmos DB ensures that Cassandra API administrators do not have to worry about managing and monitoring a myriad settings across OS, JVM, and yaml files and their interplay. Azure Cosmos DB provides monitoring of throughput, latency, storage and availability, and configurable alerts. </p>\n<p><strong>Performance management</strong>: Azure Cosmos DB provides SLA backed low latency reads and writes for the 99th percentile. Users do not need to worry about lot of operational overhead to provide good read and write SLAs. These typically include scheduling compaction, managing tombstones, bloom filters setting, and replica lags. Azure Cosmos DB takes away the worry of managing these issues and lets you focus on the application deliverables.</p>\n<p><strong>Automatic indexing</strong>: Azure Cosmos DB automatically indexes all the columns of table in Cassandra API database. Azure Cosmos DB  does not require creation of secondary indices to speed up queries. It provides low latency read and write experience while doing automatic consistent indexing. </p>\n<p><strong>Ability to use existing code and tools</strong>: Azure Cosmos DB provides wire protocol level compatibility with existing SDKs and tools. This compatibility ensures you can use your existing codebase with Cassandra API of Azure Cosmos DB with trivial changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Throughput and storage elasticity</strong>: Azure Cosmos platform provides elasticity of guaranteed throughput across regions via simple portal, PowerShell, or CLI operations. You can elastically scale Azure Cosmos DB Tables with predictable performance seamlessly as your application grows. Azure Cosmos DB supports Cassandra API tables that can scale to virtually unlimited storage sizes. </p>\n<p><strong>Global distribution and availability</strong>: Azure Cosmos DB provides the ability to distribute data throughout Azure regions to enable  users with a low latency experience while ensuring availability. Azure Cosmos DB provides 99.99% availability within a region and 99.999% read availability across the regions with no operations overhead. Azure Cosmos DB is available in 30+ <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/services/\" data-linktype=\"external\">Azure Regions</a>. Learn more in <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/distribute-data-globally\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Distribute data globally</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>Choice of consistency</strong>: Azure Cosmos DB provides the choice of five well-defined consistency levels to achieve optimal trade-off between consistency and performance. These consistency levels are strong, bounded-staleness, session, consistent prefix, and eventual. These granular, well-defined consistency levels allow developer to make sound trade-offs between consistency, availability, and latency.

Manipulating data this way was cumbersome and required learning the details of the API. This introduced an additional hurdle for new users coming from a relational database background. Exposing this low level interface also meant that language-specific drivers often needed to make significant updates from version to version. Clearly, an abstraction was needed.</p><p id=\"803a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The Cassandra Query Language (CQL) was created to provide the necessary abstraction. CQL is purposefully similar to Structured Query Language (SQL) used in relational databases like MySQL and Postgres. This similarity lowers the barrier of entry for users familiar with relational databases. Many queries are very similar between the two. In fact, a lot of basic things are even exactly the same. The following is both valid CQL and SQL:</p><h3 id=\"8c14\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Valid CQL and SQL</h3><pre id=\"0b36\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">USE </strong>myDatabase;</pre><pre id=\"7ca6\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">/* Creating Tables */</em><br /><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS</strong> myTable (id <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">INT PRIMARY KEY</strong>);</pre><pre id=\"5ed5\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\">/* Altering Tables /*<br /><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">ALTER</strong> <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">TABLE</strong> myTable <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">ADD</strong> myField <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">INT</strong>;</pre><pre id=\"e95b\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">/* Creating Indexes */</em><br /><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">CREATE INDEX </strong>myIndex <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">ON</strong> myTable (myField);</pre><pre id=\"0753\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">/* Inserting Data */</em><br /><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">INSERT INTO</strong> myTable (id, myField) <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">VALUES </strong>(1, 7);</pre><pre id=\"ea87\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">/* Selecting Data */</em><br /><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">SELECT </strong>* <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">FROM </strong>myTable <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">WHERE </strong>myField = 7;</pre><pre id=\"eb4e\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\">/* Counting Data */<br /><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">SELECT COUNT</strong>(*) <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">FROM </strong>myTable;</pre><pre id=\"e4bd\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">/* Deleting Data */</em><br /><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">DELETE FROM </strong>myTable <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">WHERE </strong>myField = 7;</pre><p id=\"cc89\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">From this, its easy to think that the two languages work just the same. But there are quite a few differences once you get beyond the basics.</p><h3 id=\"e296\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Differences</h3><p id=\"f43a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Cassandra is a non-relational database, and so uses different concepts to store and retrieve data. Simplistically, a Cassandra <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">keyspace</em> is a SQL <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">database</em>, and a Cassandra <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">column family </em>is a SQL <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">table</em> (CQL allows you to interchange the words “TABLE” and “COLUMNFAMILY” for convenience). This difference necessitates a different syntax for creating and manipulating data:</p><h4 id=\"b957\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Creating databases:</h4><pre id=\"f37e\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--h4\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">/* Create a new keyspace in CQL */</em><br /><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">CREATE KEYSPACE</strong> myDatabase <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">WITH </strong>replication = <br />   {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1};<em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">/* Create a new database in SQL */</em><br /><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">CREATE DATABASE</strong> myDatabase;</pre><p id=\"1fec\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">Cassandra’s keyspaces require more specifications than a standard relational database. Note that the example above is the simplest form. In a production environment, likely spread across several data-centers, a keyspace would be created with a different strategy and replication factor.</p><h4 id=\"55f0\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Organizing Data</h4><p id=\"b782\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">None of the standard relational stuff is going to work in CQL. There is no support for things like <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">JOIN</strong>,<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> GROUP BY</strong>, or <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">FOREIGN KEY</strong>. Leaving these features out is important because it makes writing and retrieving data from Cassandra much more efficient.</p><p id=\"ce8c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But sets of data tend to have relationships with one another. So without the relational tools of SQL, we need another strategy to represent these relationships. The problem is that reads in Cassandra tend to be more expensive than you might be used to when dealing with a relational database. But there is a filp side to this. And if you take only one thing away from this post, let it be this:</p><p id=\"4748\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Writes are cheap. Write everything the way you want to read it.</em></strong></p><p id=\"8b6a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In other words, any query you plan to do in the future should already be organized into a column family. You want to look up addresses that correspond to a person? Then make a column family that consists of people and addresses. You can still store them separately, but you should also store them together. Having a column family to represent every query makes reads much more efficient. You’re not just going to have to de-normalize, you’re going to have to forget about normalization all together.</p><h4 id=\"9cec\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Inserts vs Updates</h4><p id=\"10d8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">The concept of cheap writes extends to updating data. This is because, unlike in SQL, a read is not performed during the update. The syntax is the same in CQL and SQL.</p><pre id=\"19c7\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">/* Updating data */</em><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\"><br />UPDATE </strong>myTable <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">SET </strong>myField = 2 <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">WHERE </strong>id = 6;</pre><p id=\"9e08\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">However, if the row does not exist, it will still get created. Similarly as unintuitive, an <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">INSERT </strong>statement will actually replace data if it exists. Because again, CQL does not perform a read while inserting. Without a read, there is no way to know if the data being inserted is replacing an existing record. This means that both inserts and updates are extremely fast.</p><h4 id=\"1749\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Time to Live</h4><p id=\"3090\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">CQL enables you to set a TTL on a row. Meaning that you can set a row to expire 24 hours from the time it gets created. This is accomplished with the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">USING TTL</strong> command (values are in seconds).</p><pre id=\"76d9\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">/* Expiring Data in 24 Hours */</em><br /><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">INSERT INTO </strong>myTable (id, myField) <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">VALUES </strong>(2, 9) <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">USING TTL</strong> 86400;</pre><p id=\"e4ca\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">Twenty-four hours after that query is executed, the data will be deleted. Well, actually…</p><h4 id=\"5cb3\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Deletions</h4><p id=\"f401\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Executing a DELETE in CQL does not actually delete data. But deletions are a topic of their own. DataStax has a great <a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/dml/dml_about_deletes_c.html\" data-href=\"http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/dml/dml_about_deletes_c.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">introduction to Cassandra deletions</a> that I would definitely recommend reading.</p><h3 id=\"73fe\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Performance Issues</h3><p id=\"a811\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Scaling Cassandra can be daunting the first time around. But when you inevitably run into performance issues, there are a few things you can look at, in addition to the things mentioned above.</p><h4 id=\"85c8\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Tracing Queries</h4><p id=\"57a4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">There is a command in CQL that allows you to trace queries across nodes and data centers, showing some useful debugging information.</p><pre id=\"d671\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">/* Enable query traces */</em><br /><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">TRACING ON</strong>;</pre><pre id=\"c40a\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\">/* Disable query traces */<br /><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">TRACING OFF</strong>;</pre><p id=\"b040\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">This will show the full network path the query takes, along with the latency at each step. This is helpful for verifying assertions about the replication factor or the connectivity between nodes and data centers. Note that tracing is expensive and should be used sparingly. You definitely do not want it on for all your production queries.</p><h4 id=\"1403\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Filtering</h4><p id=\"6a6d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">If you attempt to run a SELECT across a large range of values, you might end up with an error message.</p><pre id=\"58df\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">/* Select Data within a range */</em><br /><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">SELECT </strong>* <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">FROM </strong>myTable <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">WHERE </strong>myField &gt; 5000 <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">AND </strong>myField &lt; 100000;</pre><pre id=\"6b50\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Bad Request: Cannot execute this query as it might involve data<br />filtering and thus may have unpredictable performance. If you want<br />to execute this query despite the performance unpredictability,<br />use ALLOW FILTERING.</em></pre><p id=\"15d7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">I think the error message here speaks for itself. If you’re allowing filtering on your CQL queries, think above whether or not you really need to do that.</p><h3 id=\"be01\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Conclusion</h3><p id=\"92d8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">The similarity between CQL and SQL is really a double edged sword. While you should enjoy the easy-to-learn syntax, take the time to understand the differences. There is a lot more to Cassandra than I could possibly cover here. If you’re writing production queries for the first time, I would recommend reading up on the query you’re writing, even if it is something as simple as a SELECT.

It is basically\na storage proxy, which presents a coherent API powered by Swagger specs to the\noutside, and backs up many of these entry points with storage.  The default\n<strong>table storage</strong> backend is based on Cassandra, which helps it to perform\nwell at Wikimedia's scale without placing undue burden on operations.</p>\n<p>As a proxy, RESTBase does not perform any significant content processing\nitself. Instead, it requests content transformations from backend services\nwhen needed, and typically (depending on configuration) stores it back for\nlater retrieval. For high-volume static end points, most requests will be\nsatisfied directly from storage.</p>\n<p>The <em>table storage</em> backends conform to a RESTful <a href=\"https://github.com/wikimedia/restbase/blob/master/doc/TableStorageAPI.md\">table storage\nAPI</a>\nsimilar to <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/dynamodb/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon DynamoDB</a>\nand <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/datastore/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google DataStore</a>. The primary\nimplementation uses Apache Cassandra. Notable features include automatically\nmaintained secondary indexes and some lightweight transaction support. A\n<a href=\"https://github.com/wikimedia/restbase-mod-table-sqlite\">SQLite backend</a> is\nunder development.</p>\n<p>RESTBase systematically emits statsd metrics about storage and backend\nrequests.

Then followed was another question along the line of how was it even a NoSQL database.</h2><p id=\"7ff4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Upon reading and playing around with it I began to realize that the rows and columns were just what’s on the surface. Cassandra is as NoSQL as any other databases.</p><p id=\"a05d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I’ve been working on a project that utilizes greatly on using Cassandra as a JSON storage, and that required a great understanding than working with document-based solutions like MongoDB or CouchDB, which already provide ways to store JSON out of the box. The first idea was storing a JSON blob as a string value in a single column, but that was a pretty bad idea to start with and contradicts greatly to the very reason of using Cassandra, since it would require my application to parse that JSON string every time.</p><blockquote id=\"6caa\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><div>Storing JSON in a Cassandra column as a text or []byte contradicts greatly to the very reason of using Cassandra.</div></blockquote><p id=\"e18b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Cassandra is more similar to key-value-based NoSQL databases like Redis or a hashtable. For someone coming from relational SQL world, the comfort will end at the CQL syntax and setting primary keys. Coming from NoSQL like MongoDB, however, one will have to get over the query language and schemas but once they pass the NoSQL mental model can be adapted to Cassandra very quickly.</p><p id=\"9e91\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is my best attempt at relating Cassandra schema design to a more traditional key-value data format like JSON to better educate myself with the hope of somebody else getting something out of it too.</p><h4 id=\"4ccf\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">NoSQL != Schemaless</h4><p id=\"0a72\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">NoSQL stands for <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Not Only SQL</em>. It does not mean no schemas. For many, using document- and key-value-based NoSQL databases can lead to this misconception. Even key-value data pairs like JSON has schema or structure. It’s just more flexible to changes than a relational table-based schema.</p><h4 id=\"59a3\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">The Only Difference</h4><p id=\"8dc4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">The only real distinction most, if not all, NoSQL databases have from SQL or relational databases is <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">the lack of relationship</strong> between two distinct data collections, tables, documents or whatever each database uses as the term to define a a set of related data. You kind of just query a table or a document, get the appropriate data, and then query another table to perform a cross-table query or namely the JOIN operation in the SQL world (This will lead to the argument number 2 below).</p><blockquote id=\"4f3c\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><div>The only distinction NoSQL databases have from a relational SQL-based databases is the lack of inter-collection relationships.</div></blockquote><p id=\"3a88\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">The long-standing argument between the SQL and NoSQL camps sums up to:</p><ol class=\"postList\"><li id=\"9f60\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">the fact that a relational database can never scale as easily as NoSQL.</li><li id=\"c3d5\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Relational databases provide more flexible and robust queries while for NoSQL, without knowing the structure or schema, one is forced to think hard about how an application will access the data. This is known as <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">query-driven design</strong>.</li></ol><p id=\"4886\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">I will not talk about the topic of scalability since most NoSQL users should be well-aware of that, and it’s best discussed somewhere else. However, I will focus on the underlying structure of Cassandra for the hope of a better understanding that will lead to a better query-driven designed schemas.</p><h4 id=\"c639\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Cassandra as a Key-value Database</h4><p id=\"f453\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Cassandra can be thought of as a key-value database. Under the hood and beyond its Cassandra Query Language (CQL) and schemas, it actually contains a lookup key for every data in the form of a <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">primary key</strong>.</p><p id=\"7a52\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Considering this <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">user_tweets</em> table:</p></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\"><figure id=\"a94f\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*FQxcoFtHTLP469zlxtSIMA.png\" data-width=\"1230\" data-height=\"360\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*FQxcoFtHTLP469zlxtSIMA.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*FQxcoFtHTLP469zlxtSIMA.png\" alt=\"image\" /></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">“user_tweets” table</figcaption></div></figure></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p id=\"a6a3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">username</em> field acts as a first and only primary key, which in Cassandra’s speak is called the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">partition key</strong>. A partition key is very important in Cassandra and it basically groups all the related rows together for efficient storage and lookup. This will become clearer once we have more than one tweet per username. The partition key hence can be seen as the “lookup” key similar to what you might have dealt with in any hash table, map, dictionary or other key-value structure.</p></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\"><figure id=\"2d54\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*9G4Vw6BaaeM77G2JXENtbQ.png\" data-width=\"1453\" data-height=\"670\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*9G4Vw6BaaeM77G2JXENtbQ.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*9G4Vw6BaaeM77G2JXENtbQ.png\" alt=\"image\" /></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">key-value relationship of the “user_tweet” table</figcaption></div></figure></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p id=\"4744\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">We can simplify it to a JSON structure (not entirely accurate, but useful as a mental model for someone coming from Redis or MongoDB).</p><figure id=\"c29e\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"><div class=\"iframeContainer\"><iframe width=\"700\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://medium.com/media/8e16adb780c4d577634bc7b5966722cd?postId=9714cee9236a\" data-media-id=\"8e16adb780c4d577634bc7b5966722cd\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\">[embedded content]</iframe></div></div></div></figure><p id=\"cd31\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">One thing that should be noted very cautiously is that in Cassandra, unlike what the JSON array might portray, each partition of grouped rows under a partition key is stored non-contiguously, possibly on different nodes, making it very costly to access each of them together. In the previous table, if you look at the key-value relationship diagram, you’ll see that each row is not related to one another at all and is stored apart from one another.</p><p id=\"cbc8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This can never be overstated. We can never access the second-level data (for instance, the email of a user) without accessing the primary username key first. Think of it as a JSON array as portrayed previously. To get to my <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">email</em>, the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">username</em> must be provided as the key beforehand.</p><pre id=\"3e21\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">var</strong> tweets = JSON.parse(tweet_data)<br /><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">var</strong> my_email = tweets[0]['jochasinga']['email'];</pre><p id=\"7828\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">The CQL rough equivalence of the above would have been</p><pre id=\"2305\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">SELECT</strong> \"email\" <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">FROM</strong> \"user_tweets\" <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">WHERE</strong> \"username\" = 'jochasinga';</pre><p id=\"ab4e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">We supply the primary key, or the “lookup” key to the WHERE clause, hence it’s very cheap to retrieve the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">email </em>value<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> </em>of that <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">username</em>.</p><p id=\"7a56\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If we try to query a row by supplying another non-key column to the WHERE clause, we would be getting an error warning us that it’d be very unwise to do so.</p><pre id=\"0941\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">SELECT</strong> * <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">FROM</strong> \"user_tweets\" <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">WHERE</strong> \"email\" = 'jo.chasinga@gmail.com';</pre><p id=\"52ce\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">The above CQL query, reads “select all columns from <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">user_tweets</em> table where the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">email</em> is ‘jo.chasinga@gmail.com’.”, would return an erratic warning:</p><pre id=\"a834\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">InvalidRequest: code=2200 [Invalid query] message=”Cannot execute this query as it might involve data filtering and thus may have unpredictable performance. If you want to execute this query despite the performance unpredictability, use ALLOW FILTERING</pre><p id=\"56af\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">It makes sense if you think about it. In a table with many more rows, querying by a non-key column like <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">email </em>tells Cassandra to iterate through every primary key<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> username </em>before hitting the right <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">email</em> value and retrieving the row. Here’s the rough approximation of the query in Javascript querying the previous JSON:</p><pre id=\"3a30\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">tweets.<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">forEach</strong>(function(elm, i, arr) {</pre><pre id=\"88d4\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\">    // Retrieve an array of all the keys<br /><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">var</strong> keys = Object.keys[elm]<br /><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">if </strong>elm[keys[0]]['email'] == \"jo.chasinga@gmail.com\" {<br /><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">return</strong> elm<br />    }<br />}</pre><p id=\"ed01\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">If you have a million rows of tweets, or in the JSON version, a million objects, you would end up traversing through every one blindly hopefully hitting your luck early. Also remember that each partition is possibly stored on a separate node from one another. You are of course given an option to execute this query anyway by using <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">ALLOW FILTERING</em> flag, but you’ve been warned.</p><p id=\"48e2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Things start to become clearer when we introduce another <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">tweet_id</em> column as a <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">clustering column</strong> for the tweet table.

This is just like a reverse lookup. For instance, querying with a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">username</em> you<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> </em>can get the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">email</em> of the user.</p><pre id=\"97f7\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">SELECT</strong> \"email\" <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">FROM </strong>\"user_tweets\" <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">WHERE </strong>\"username\" = 'jochasinga';</pre><p id=\"5ed5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">In some case, we may want to query a username based on the email. By creating an index on <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">email</em>, you can perform that kind of reverse lookup.</p><blockquote id=\"f931\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><div>Note: Right now it is not possible to create an index on a static column, though in theory that can be done.

For instance, when a user search for all the tweets with hashtag <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">#funnycats,</em> Twitter could have queried it this way:</p><pre id=\"46f9\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">SELECT </strong>* <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">FROM</strong> \"user_tweets\" <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">WHERE</strong> \"hashtags\" <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">CONTAINS</strong> \"funnycats\";</pre><p id=\"0525\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">Pretty self-descriptive.</p><p id=\"cca3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But without “marking” the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">hashtags</em> column, it would return a complaint just like how we tried querying with a non-key column value.</p><p id=\"48e4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Let’s add the hashtags column and see how that goes.</p><pre id=\"76aa\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">ALTER</strong> <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">TABLE</strong> \"user_tweets\" <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">ADD</strong> \"hashtags\" list&lt;text&gt;;</pre><p id=\"c6e1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">At this point, we will have to alter the data of the previous tweets’ <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">hashtags</em> column, since the column we have just added contains nothing on each row.</p><pre id=\"0979\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">UPDATE</strong> \"user_tweets\" SET \"hashtags\" = ['art', 'graffiti', 'nyc'] <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">WHERE</strong> \"username\" = 'jochasinga' <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">AND</strong> \"id\" = bd48ac00-8310-11e5-985d-dd516b67e698;</pre><pre id=\"fe8f\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">UPDATE</strong> \"user_tweets\" SET \"hashtags\" = ['rad'] <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">WHERE</strong> \"username\" = 'banksy' <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">AND</strong> \"id\" = 76e7a4d0-e796-11e3-90ce-5f98e903bf02;</pre><pre id=\"6c62\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">UPDATE</strong> \"user_tweets\" SET \"hashtags\" = ['sad', 'HopeForUkraine'] <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">WHERE</strong> \"username\" = 'random_may' <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">AND</strong> \"id\" = fa507380-8310-11e5-985d-dd516b67e698;</pre><p id=\"e8d6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">Then create a secondary index on the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">hashtags</em> column</p><pre id=\"6c02\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">CREATE INDEX ON</strong> \"user_tweets\" (\"hashtags\")</pre><p id=\"e590\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">We will turn up with a new version of user_tweets that looks like this:</p></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\"><figure id=\"87d1\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*Fmu-Q_iiGJgrvJky2q7ViA.png\" data-width=\"2070\" data-height=\"436\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Fmu-Q_iiGJgrvJky2q7ViA.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Fmu-Q_iiGJgrvJky2q7ViA.png\" alt=\"image\" /></div></div></figure></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p id=\"9e5a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Now we will be able to query against the hashtags like Twitter search would have done it.</p><pre id=\"7417\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">SELECT</strong> * <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">FROM</strong> \"user_tweets\" <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">WHERE</strong> \"hashtags\" <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">CONTAINS </strong>'art';</pre><p id=\"2d1a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">Guess which row will be returned.

stage I created three projects.</p>\n<ol><li>InteroperationalBlackBox – A basic class library that will be used by a console application or whatever other application or service that may need access to the specific business logic or what not.</li>\n<li>InteroperationalBlackBox.Tests – An <a href=\"https://xunit.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">xunit</a> testing project for testing anything that might need some good ole’ testing.</li>\n<li>InteroperationalBlackBox.Cli – A console application (CLI) that I’ll use to interact with the class library and add capabilities going forward.</li>\n</ol><p>Alright, now that all the basic projects are setup in the solution, I’ll go out and see about the <a href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/csharp-driver-dse/2.3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">.NET DataStax Enterprise driver</a>. Inside Jetbrains Rider I can right click on a particular project that I want to add or manage dependencies for. I did that and then put “<em>dse</em>” in the search box. The dialog pops up from the bottom of the IDE and you can add it by clicking on the bottom right plus sign in the description box to the right. Once you click the plus sign, once installed, it becomes a little red x.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"14252\" data-permalink=\"https://compositecode.blog/2018/08/05/dse6-net-v/dse-adding-package/\" data-orig-file=\"https://compositecode.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/dse-adding-package.png?w=788\" data-orig-size=\"1398,594\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"dse-adding-package\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://compositecode.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/dse-adding-package.png?w=788?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://compositecode.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/dse-adding-package.png?w=788?w=788\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14252\" src=\"https://compositecode.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/dse-adding-package.png?w=788\" alt=\"dse-adding-package\" srcset=\"https://compositecode.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/dse-adding-package.png?w=788 788w, https://compositecode.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/dse-adding-package.png?w=150 150w, https://compositecode.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/dse-adding-package.png?w=300 300w, https://compositecode.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/dse-adding-package.png?w=768 768w, https://compositecode.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/dse-adding-package.png?w=1024 1024w, https://compositecode.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/dse-adding-package.png 1398w\" /></p>\n<p>Alright. Now it’s <em>almost</em> time to get some code working. We need ourselves a database first however. I’m going to setup a cluster in <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Cloud Platform</a> (GCP), but feel free to use whatever cluster you’ve got. These instructions will basically be reusable across wherever you’ve got your cluster setup. I wrote up a walk through and instructions for the GCP Marketplace a few weeks ago. I used the same offering to get this example cluster up and running to use. So, now back to getting the first snippets of code working.</p>\n<p>Let’s write a test first.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n[Fact]\npublic void ConfirmDatabase_Connects_False()\n{\n    var box = new BlackBox();\n    Assert.Equal(false, box.ConfirmConnection());\n}\n</pre>\n<p>In this test, I named the class called BlackBox and am planning to have a parameterless constructor. But as things go tests are very fluid, or ought to be, and I may change it in the next iteration. I’m thinking, at least to get started, that I’ll have a method to test and confirm a connection for the CLI. I’ve named it ConfirmConnection for that purpose. Initially I’m going to test for false, but that’s primarily just to get started. Now, time to implement.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nnamespace InteroperabilityBlackBox\nusing System;\nusing Dse;\nusing Dse.Auth;\n\nnamespace InteroperabilityBlackBox\n{\n    public class BlackBox\n    {\n        public BlackBox()\n        {}\n\n        public bool ConfirmConnection()\n        {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</pre>\n<p>That gives a passing test and I move forward. For more of the run through of moving from this first step to the finished code session check out this</p>\n\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"788\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2a6_oDV5Dqs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">[embedded content]</iframe></div>\n<p>By the end of the coding session I had a few tests.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nusing Xunit;\n\nnamespace InteroperabilityBlackBox.Tests\n{\n    public class MakingSureItWorksIntegrationTests\n    {\n        [Fact]\n        public void ConfirmDatabase_Connects_False()\n        {\n            var box = new BlackBox();\n            Assert.Equal(false, box.ConfirmConnection());\n        }\n\n        [Fact]\n        public void ConfirmDatabase_PassedValuesConnects_True()\n        {\n            var box = new BlackBox(\"cassandra\", \"\", \"\");\n            Assert.Equal(false, box.ConfirmConnection());\n        }\n\n        [Fact]\n        public void ConfirmDatabase_PassedValuesConnects_False()\n        {\n            var box = new BlackBox(\"cassandra\", \"notThePassword\", \"\");\n            Assert.Equal(false, box.ConfirmConnection());\n        }\n    }\n}\n</pre>\n<p>The respective code for connecting to the database cluster, per the walk through I wrote about here, at session end looked like this.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nusing System;\nusing Dse;\nusing Dse.Auth;\n\nnamespace InteroperabilityBlackBox\n{\n    public class BlackBox : IBoxConnection\n    {\n        public BlackBox(string username, string password, string contactPoint)\n        {\n            UserName = username;\n            Password = password;\n            ContactPoint = contactPoint;\n        }\n\n        public BlackBox()\n        {\n            UserName = \"ConfigValueFromSecretsVault\";\n            Password = \"ConfigValueFromSecretsVault\";\n            ContactPoint = \"ConfigValue\";\n        }\n\n        public string ContactPoint { get; set; }\n        public string UserName { get; set; }\n        public string Password { get; set; }\n\n        public bool ConfirmConnection()\n        {\n            IDseCluster cluster = DseCluster.Builder()\n                .AddContactPoint(ContactPoint)\n                .WithAuthProvider(new DsePlainTextAuthProvider(UserName, Password))\n                .Build();\n\n            try\n            {\n                cluster.Connect();\n                return true;\n            }\n            catch (Exception e)\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(e);\n                return false;\n            }\n\n        }\n    }\n}\n</pre>\n<p>With my interface providing the contract to meet.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nnamespace InteroperabilityBlackBox\n{\n    public interface IBoxConnection\n    {\n        string ContactPoint { get; set; }\n        string UserName { get; set; }\n        string Password { get; set; }\n        bool ConfirmConnection();\n    }\n}\n</pre>\n<h2>Conclusions &amp; Next Steps</h2>\n<p>After I wrapped up the session two things stood out that needed fixed for the next session. I’ll be sure to add these as objectives for the next coding session at 3pm PST on Thursday.</p>\n<ol><li>The tests really needed to more resiliently confirm the integrations that I was working to prove out. My plan at this point is to add some Docker images that would provide the development integration tests a point to work against. This would alleviate the need for something outside of the actual project in the repository to exist. Removing that fragility.</li>\n<li>The application, in its “Black Box”, should do something. For the next session we’ll write up some feature requests we’d want, or maybe someone has some suggestions of functionality they’d like to see implemented in a CLI using .NET Core working against a DataStax Enterprise Cassandra Database Cluster? Feel free to leave a comment or three about a feature, I’ll work on adding it during the next session.</li>\n</ol><ul><li>Project Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/Adron/InteroperabilityBlackBoxhttps://github.com/Adron/InteroperabilityBlackBox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/Adron/InteroperabilityBlackBox</a></li>\n<li>File an Feature Request: <a href=\"https://github.com/Adron/InteroperabilityBlackBox/issues/new?template=feature_request.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/Adron/InteroperabilityBlackBox/issues/new?template=feature_request.md</a></li>\n</ul>",

        "title": "The Gossip Protocol - Inside Apache Cassandra.",
        "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gossip-protocol-inside-apache-cassandra-soham-saha/",
        "content": "<p>The Gossip protocol is the <em>internal</em> communication technique for nodes in a cluster to talk to each other. Gossip is an efficient, lightweight, reliable inter-nodal broadcast protocol for diffusing data. It's decentralized, <em>\"epidemic\"</em>, fault tolerant and a peer-to-peer communication protocol. Cassandra uses gossiping for peer discovery and metadata propagation.</p><div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-middle\"><img data-media-urn=\"urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:C5612AQGRg4ztrilMrQ\" data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQGRg4ztrilMrQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1539820800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=tlB2x1ZliULUkuJdHgSjHFgCAdgDyMjvfx-nCZIcHFs\" src=\"https://:0/\" alt=\"image\" /></div> \n<p>The gossip process runs every second for every node and exchange state messages with up to three other nodes in the cluster. Since the whole process is decentralized, there is nothing or no one that coordinates each node to gossip. Each node independently will always select one to three peers to gossip with. It will always select a live peer (if any) in the cluster, it will probabilistically pick a seed node from the cluster or maybe it will probabilistically select an unavailable node.</p> \n<div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"><img data-media-urn=\"urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:C4E12AQHDjuit_L71uA\" data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQHDjuit_L71uA/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0?e=1539820800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=mfvG4KO0gLxazt24hjVbc1FH-cfWCthVrNP_xdkOstI\" src=\"https://:0/\" alt=\"image\" /></div> \n<p>The Gossip messaging is very similar to the TCP three-way handshake. With a regular broadcast protocol, there could only have been one message per round, and the data can be allowed to gradually spread through the cluster. But with the gossip protocol, having three messages for each round of gossip adds a degree of <em>anti-entropy</em>. This process allows obtaining \"convergence\" of data shared between the two interacting nodes much faster.</p> \n<p>SYN: The node initiating the round of gossip sends the SYN message which contains a compendium of the nodes in the cluster. It contains tuples of the IP address of a node in the cluster, the generation and the heartbeat version of the node.</p> \n<p>ACK: The peer after receiving SYN message compares its own metadata information with the one sent by the initiator and produces a diff. ACK contains two kinds of data. One part consists of updated metadata information (AppStates) that the peer has but the initiator doesn't, and the other part consists of digest of nodes the initiator has that the peer doesn't.</p> \n<p>ACK2: The initiator receives the ACK from peer and updates its metadata from the AppStates and sends back ACK2 containing the metadata information the peer has requested for. The peer receives ACK2, updates its metadata and the round of gossip concludes.</p> \n<p>An important note here is that this messaging protocol will cause only a constant amount of network traffic. Since the broadcasting of the initial digest is limited to three nodes and data convergence occurs through a pretty constant ACK and ACK2, there will not be much of network spike. Although, if a node gets UP, all the nodes might want to send data to that peer, causing the <em>Gossip Storm</em>.</p> \n<p>So how does a new node get the idea of whom to start gossiping with? Well, Cassandra has many seed provider implementations that provide a list of seed addresses to the new node and starts gossiping with one of them right away. After its first round of gossip, it will now possess cluster membership information about all the other nodes in the cluster and can then gossip with the rest of them.</p> \n<p>Well, how do we get to know if a node is UP/DOWN? The Failure Detector is the only component inside Cassandra(only the primary gossip class can mark a node UP besides) to do so. It is a heartbeat listener and marks down the timestamps and keeps backlogs of intervals at which it receives heartbeat updates from each peer. Based on the reported data, it determines whether a peer is UP/DOWN.</p> \n<p>How does a node being UP/DOWN affect the cluster? The write operations stay unaffected. If a node does not get an acknowledgment for a write to a peer, it simply stores it up as a <em>hint. </em>The nodes will stop sending read requests to a peer in DOWN state and probabilistically gossiping can be tried upon since its an unavailable node, as we have already discussed early on. All repair, stream sessions are closed as well when an unavailable node is involved.</p> \n<p>What if a peer is responding very slowly or timing out? Cassandra has another component called the Dynamic Snitch, which records and analyses latencies of read requests to peer nodes. It ranks latencies of peers in a rolling window and recalculates it every 100ms and resets the scores every 10mins to allow for any other events(Eg: Garbage Collection) delaying the response time of a peer. In this way, the Dynamic Snitch helps you identify the <em>slow </em>nodes and avoid them when indulging in Gossip.</p> \n<p>This article gives you the necessary overview and understanding of how the nodes in clusters in Apache Cassandra behaves via the gossip protocol.

Remember that this timestamp will be used for “read-repair” and so that all your clients must be synchronized (using a NTP for instance)</p>\n<pre><code class=\"java\">insertClientDataMap.put(\"customers\", clientRowData);</code></pre>\n<p>The above lines put the list of Columns into the ColumnFamily named customers (so you can add several ColumnFamily in one time with the batch_insert method). Then, the following line inserts the customer into the Cassandra Storage. You need so to specify the keyspace, the row key (here the customer name), the Column family you want to insert and the Consistency Level you have chosen for this data.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"java\">cassandraClient.batch_insert(\"myBank\", aCustomer.getName(), insertClientDataMap,  ConsistencyLevel.DCQUORUM);</code></pre>\n<h2>Use Case #2: Insert operations for an account</h2>\n<p>Inserting an operation is almost the same code instead we are using SuperColumn. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"java\">Map&lt; string , List&lt; ColumnOrSuperColumn &gt; &gt; insertOperationDataMap = new HashMap&lt; string , List&lt; ColumnOrSuperColumn &gt; &gt;();&#13;\nList&lt; ColumnOrSuperColumn&gt; operationRowData = new ArrayList&lt; ColumnOrSuperColumn &gt;();&#13;\nList&lt; Column &gt; columns = new ArrayList&lt; Column &gt;();&#13;\n&#13;\n// THESE ARE THE SUPERCOLUMN COLUMNS&#13;\ncolumns.add(new Column(\"amount\".getBytes(UTF8),  &#13;\naBankOperation.getAmount().getBytes(UTF8), timestamp));&#13;\ncolumns.add(new Column(\"label\".getBytes(UTF8),  &#13;\naBankOperation.getLabel().getBytes(UTF8), timestamp));&#13;\nif (aBankOperation.getType() != null) {&#13;\n\tcolumns.add(new Column(\"type\".getBytes(UTF8),  &#13;\naBankOperation.getType().getBytes(UTF8), timestamp));&#13;\n}&#13;\nFor now, there is nothing new. A list of Columns is created with three columns: amount, label and type (withdrawal, transfer...). &#13;\n// here is a superColumn&#13;\nSuperColumn superColumn = new  &#13;\nSuperColumn(CassandraUUIDHelper.asByteArray(CassandraUUIDHelper.getTimeUUID()),  &#13;\ncolumns);&#13;\nColumnOrSuperColumn columnOrSuperColumn = new ColumnOrSuperColumn();&#13;\ncolumnOrSuperColumn.setSuper_column(superColumn);&#13;\noperationRowData.add(columnOrSuperColumn);</code></pre>\n<p>This case is different from the previous one. Instead of adding the previously defined Columns to the row, we create a SuperColumn with a dynamic (and time-based UUID) name…Quite dynamic isn’t it? Then, the three columns are added to the super column itself.<br />\nThe end of the code is similar to the previous one. The row is added to the ColumnFamily named operations and then associated to the current customer account id. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"java\">// put row data dans la columnFamily operations&#13;\ninsertOperationDataMap.put(\"operations\", operationRowData);&#13;\ncassandraClient.batch_insert(\"myBank\", aCustomer.getAccountIds(),  &#13;\ninsertOperationDataMap, ConsistencyLevel.ONE);</code></pre>\n<p>Here is what you get when reading the operations for the accounId<br /><a href=\"https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/exit.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/exit.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"exit\" width=\"564\" height=\"319\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11797\" srcset=\"https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/exit.png 564w, https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/exit-300x170.png 300w, https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/exit-160x90.png 160w\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Use Case #3 : Removing an item</h2>\n<p>Removing a complete row is – in terms of API – as simple as the rest of the API. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"java\">cassandraClient.remove(\"myBank\", myAccountId, new ColumnPath(\"operations\"),  timestamp, ConsistencyLevel.ONE);</code></pre>\n<p>It is yet a little more complex when you are looking<a href=\"http://spyced.blogspot.com/2010/02/distributed-deletes-in-cassandra.html\"> inside</a>. In brief, in a distributed system where node failure will occur, you can’t simply physically delete the record. So you replace it by a tombstone and the “mark as deleted” record will be effectively deleted once the tombstone will be considered enough old. At least, you can still use “logical deletion” and write a code that do not use these flagged records. </p>\n<h2>To (quickly) conclude this series of articles</h2>\n<p>I really like Cassandra which looks like a ready to use tools (even if NoSQL is plenty of great tools) and a way to achieve high performance system at “low” (at least lower) cost than with commercial tools. There are still concerns I hope I will be able to discuss like security (Cassandra provides authentication mechanisms…), searching (or at least getting ranges of datas), monitoring (and how to monitor all the nodes of your cluster into a unique tools like <a href=\"http://ganglia.sourceforge.net/\">Ganglia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nagios.org/\">Nagios</a> or <a href=\"http://graphite.wikidot.com/start\">Graphite</a> or even how to use <a href=\"http://hadoop.apache.org/\">Hadoop</a> above Cassandra. </p>\n<p>To be continued…</p>\n<div class=\"sharify-container\"><ul><li class=\"sharify-btn-twitter\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a title=\"Tweet on Twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Let%26%238217%3Bs+play+with+Cassandra%26%238230%3B+%28Part+3%2F3%29: https://blog.octo.com/en/nosql-lets-play-with-cassandra-part-33/\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"sharify sharify-twitter\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTweet&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</i></a>&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li class=\"sharify-btn-facebook\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a title=\"Share on Facebook\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.octo.com%2Fen%2Fnosql-lets-play-with-cassandra-part-33%2F\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"sharify sharify-facebook\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</i></a>&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li class=\"sharify-btn-gplus\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a title=\"Share on Google+\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://blog.octo.com/en/nosql-lets-play-with-cassandra-part-33/\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"sharify sharify-gplus\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+1&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</i></a>&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li class=\"sharify-btn-linkedin\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a title=\"Share on Linkedin\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://blog.octo.com/en/nosql-lets-play-with-cassandra-part-33/&amp;title=Let’s play with Cassandra… (Part 3/3)\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"sharify sharify-linkedin\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLinkedIn&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</i></a>&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li></ul></div><div class=\"yarpp-related\">\n<h3>Related posts:</h3><ol><li><a href=\"https://blog.octo.com/en/nosqleu-and-nosql-what%e2%80%99s-the-deal/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"no:sql(eu) and NoSQL: What’s the deal?\">no:sql(eu) and NoSQL: What’s the deal? </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.octo.com/en/nosql-lets-play-with-cassandra-part-13/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Let’s play with Cassandra… (Part 1/3)\">Let’s play with Cassandra… (Part 1/3) </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.octo.com/en/nosql-lets-play-with-cassandra-part-23/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Let’s play with Cassandra…(Part 2/3)\">Let’s play with Cassandra…(Part 2/3) </a></li>\n</ol></div>",

The idea is to provide a kind of simplified current account system where a user has an account and the account has a balance…<br />\nThis system will so manipulate the following concepts:<br />\n– A client has different kind of properties defining his identity<br />\n– A client has one account<br />\n– The account has a list of operations (withdrawal, transfer are all kind of operations)<br />\nHere is the way it would have been modelized in the relational world (or at least UML world)<br /><a href=\"https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/uml1.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/uml1.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"uml\" width=\"530\" height=\"172\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11785\" srcset=\"https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/uml1.png 530w, https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/uml1-300x97.png 300w, https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/uml1-160x52.png 160w\" /></a><br /></p>\n<h2>The Cassandra set up</h2>\n<p>I will not drive deep into the details of a Cassandra set up. <a href=\"http://www.sodeso.nl/?p=80\">This article explains</a> it in details but here are the main points. </p>\n<h3>Define your cluster</h3>\n<p>Each nodes of the cluster has a configuration file called storage-conf.xml where are defined the following main sections<br />\n– <strong>Cluster and Keyspace definition</strong>. The cluster is made of several nodes (the Seed) which store all the Keyspaces you will define (and of course data).<br />\nAs we talked about in the previous part [add a link], you define the Keyspace that will contain all the ColumnFamily. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"xml\">&lt;storage&gt;&#13;\n  &lt;clustername&gt;Test Cluster&lt;/clustername&gt;&#13;\n  &lt;autobootstrap&gt;false&lt;/autobootstrap&gt;&#13;\n&lt;keyspaces&gt;&#13;\n    &lt;keyspace Name=\"myBank\"&gt;&#13;\n...&#13;\n&lt;/keyspace&gt;&lt;/keyspaces&gt;&#13;\n...&#13;\n&lt;partitioner&gt;org.apache.cassandra.dht.RandomPartitioner&lt;/partitioner&gt;&#13;\n&lt;initialtoken&gt;&lt;/initialtoken&gt;&#13;\n &lt;seeds&gt;&#13;\n    &lt;seed&gt;192.168.216.129&lt;/seed&gt;&#13;\n    &lt;seed&gt;192.168.216.130&lt;/seed&gt;&#13;\n  &lt;/seeds&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/storage&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Then, you define the IP address of all the nodes (ie. The seeds) that will compose your cluster. During the startup phase, all the nodes will communicate to each other (using Gossip protocol), thus detecting starting or node failures.  You can go further in the definition of your cluster topology and group (as far as I know in another conf file) IPs by datacenters. </p>\n<p>The InitialToken, if not defined, will automatically be set by Cassandra (based on the cluster topology and following the Consistent Hashing algorithm). The documentation gives more details about <a href=\"http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Operations\">ring management</a><br />\nThe partitioner is a much more tricky and Cassandra provides, by default, <a href=\"http://spyced.blogspot.com/2009/05/consistent-hashing-vs-order-preserving.html\">two partitioners</a> : the <a href=\"http://ria101.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/cassandra-randompartitioner-vs-orderpreservingpartitioner/\">RandomPartitioner and the OrderPreservingPartitioner</a>. In the first case, the data will be partitioned using a row key hash (typically md5). In the second case, the data will be partitioned in their natural order and thus facilitates the range queries. So once again, the choice you made (and you cannot change it during your cluster life) is depending on the way your data is manipulated.</p>\n<p>– <strong>Node access</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"xml\">&lt;listenaddress&gt;192.168.216.128&lt;/listenaddress&gt;&#13;\n  &lt;storageport&gt;7000&lt;/storageport&gt;&#13;\n&#13;\n  &lt;thriftaddress&gt;192.168.216.128&lt;/thriftaddress&gt;&#13;\n  &lt;!-- Thrift RPC port (the port clients connect to). --&gt;&#13;\n  &lt;thriftport&gt;9160&lt;/thriftport&gt;&#13;\n...</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>ListenAddress</code> and <code>ThriftAddress</code> enable to define the current IP and listening port for the current node. The first IP is used by all the nodes to gossip each others. The second address is the one used by thrift clients to connect to the node and insert, delete or update data.</p>\n<h3>Define your data models</h3>\n<p>In our example, we will define two ColumnFamily. The first one will store all the customers. The second one all the operations. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"xml\">&lt;keyspace Name=\"myBank\"&gt;&#13;\n&lt;columnfamily CompareWith=\"UTF8Type\" Name=\"customers\"/&gt;&#13;\n&lt;columnfamily CompareWith=\"TimeUUIDType\" Name=\"operations\" ColumnType=\"Super\" CompareSubcolumnsWith=\"UTF8Type\"/&gt;&#13;\n&#13;\n&lt;!-- Number of replicas of the data --&gt;&#13;\n&lt;replicationfactor&gt;2&lt;/replicationfactor&gt;&#13;\n       &lt;replicaplacementstrategy&gt;org.apache.cassandra.locator.RackUnawareStrategy&lt;/replicaplacementstrategy&gt;&#13;\n&lt;keyscachedfraction&gt;0.01&lt;/keyscachedfraction&gt;&#13;\n      &lt;endpointsnitch&gt;org.apache.cassandra.locator.EndPointSnitch&lt;/endpointsnitch&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/keyspace&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>To begin with the simplest things, the replicationFactor defines the number of nodes the data will be replicated. Then let’s talk about the ColumnFamily. First, you will notice that the schema for each ColumnFamily is not defined (whereas the actual 0.6 version of Cassandra does not allow dynamically adding or removing ColumnFamily, the 0.7 should provide this feature) and you only know that customers and operations will be stored.<br />\nData modeling<br />\nIf you look at the UML diagram representing the different concepts, you will notice that there is a “one-to-many” relationship between an account and the operations on this account. An easy way to model this in Cassandra is by using the <a href=\"https://blog.octo.com/en/nosql-lets-play-with-cassandra-part-13\">SuperColumn</a>. Thus the operation has the following structure: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/column-oriented-model.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/column-oriented-model.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"column-oriented model\" width=\"553\" height=\"271\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11802\" srcset=\"https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/column-oriented-model.png 553w, https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/column-oriented-model-300x147.png 300w, https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/column-oriented-model-160x78.png 160w\" /></a></p>\n<p>Thus:<br />\n–\tThe key is the account Id<br />\n–\tThe “Value” is a SuperColumn which stores all the operations for this account (the limitation of this model is the number of operations you could have…). Thus the operation is a list of columns (type, amount, date…) ordered by a <a href=\"http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/FAQ\">time-based UUID</a> inside the SuperColumn. The CompareWith tells Cassandra how to sort the columns (remember the column are sorted, within a row, by their name. In our examples, I want my operations (whose name is a time-based UUID) to be chronologically sorted. That’s what I specify to Cassandra with the CompareWith attribute. The CompareSubcolumnsWith attribute will be responsible for sorting the Column included in the SuperColumn…<br />\nHere is what you get using the Cassandra-cli tools<br /><a href=\"https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/exit.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/exit.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"exit\" width=\"564\" height=\"319\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11797\" srcset=\"https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/exit.png 564w, https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/exit-300x170.png 300w, https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/exit-160x90.png 160w\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"sharify-container\"><ul><li class=\"sharify-btn-twitter\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a title=\"Tweet on Twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Let%26%238217%3Bs+play+with+Cassandra%26%238230%3B%28Part+2%2F3%29: https://blog.octo.com/en/nosql-lets-play-with-cassandra-part-23/\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"sharify sharify-twitter\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTweet&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</i></a>&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li class=\"sharify-btn-facebook\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a title=\"Share on Facebook\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.octo.com%2Fen%2Fnosql-lets-play-with-cassandra-part-23%2F\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"sharify sharify-facebook\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</i></a>&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li class=\"sharify-btn-gplus\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a title=\"Share on Google+\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://blog.octo.com/en/nosql-lets-play-with-cassandra-part-23/\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"sharify sharify-gplus\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+1&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</i></a>&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li class=\"sharify-btn-linkedin\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a title=\"Share on Linkedin\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://blog.octo.com/en/nosql-lets-play-with-cassandra-part-23/&amp;title=Let’s play with Cassandra…(Part 2/3)\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"sharify sharify-linkedin\">&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLinkedIn&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</i></a>&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li></ul></div><div class=\"yarpp-related\">\n<h3>Related posts:</h3><ol><li><a href=\"https://blog.octo.com/en/nosqleu-and-nosql-what%e2%80%99s-the-deal/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"no:sql(eu) and NoSQL: What’s the deal?\">no:sql(eu) and NoSQL: What’s the deal? </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.octo.com/en/nosql-lets-play-with-cassandra-part-13/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Let’s play with Cassandra… (Part 1/3)\">Let’s play with Cassandra… (Part 1/3) </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.octo.com/en/nosql-lets-play-with-cassandra-part-33/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Let’s play with Cassandra… (Part 3/3)\">Let’s play with Cassandra… (Part 3/3) </a></li>\n</ol></div>",

        "url": "https://blog.octo.com/en/nosql-lets-play-with-cassandra-part-13/",
        "content": "<p>I have already talked about it but <a href=\"https://blog.octo.com/en/nosqleu-and-nosql-what&#x2019;s-the-deal/\">NoSQL</a> is about diversity and includes various different tools and even kind of tools. Cassandra is one of these tools and is certainly and currently one of the most popular in the NoSQL ecosystem. <strong>Built by Facebook and currently in production at web giants like Digg, Twitter, Cassandra is a hybrid solution between <a href=\"http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/10/amazons_dynamo.html\">Dynamo</a> and </strong><strong><a href=\"http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/labs.google.com/fr//papers/bigtable-osdi06.pdf\">BigTable</a></strong>. </p>\n<p>Hybrid firstly because <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/ladis2009/papers/lakshman-ladis2009.pdf\">Cassandra </a>uses a <strong>column-oriented way of modeling data</strong> (inspired by the BigTable) and permit to use <strong>Hadoop Map/Reduce jobs</strong> and secondly because it uses patterns inspired by Dynamo like <strong>Eventually Consistent, Gossip protocols, a master-master way of serving both read and write requests</strong>…</p>\n<p>Another DNA of Cassandra (and in fact a lot of NoSQL solutions) is that <strong>Cassandra has been built to be fully decentralized, designed for failure and Datacenter aware </strong>(in a sense you can configure Cassandra to ensure data replication between several Datacenter…). Hence, Cassandra is currently used between the <a href=\"http://spyced.blogspot.com/2010/04/cassandra-fact-vs-fiction.html\">Facebook US west and east coast datacenters</a> and stored (around two years ago) <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/ladis2009/papers/lakshman-ladis2009.pdf\">50+ TB of data on a 150 node cluster</a>.<br /></p>\n<h2>Data Modeling</h2>\n<p>The column oriented model is quite more complex to understand than the <a href=\"https://blog.octo.com/amazon-simpledb-le-harry-potter-de-voldemort/\">Key/Value model</a>. In a Key/value model, you have a key that uniquely identify a value and this value can be structured (based on a JSON format for instance) or completely unstructured (typically a BLOB). Therefore and from the basis, the simplest way to understand the column-oriented model is to begin with a Key/Value model and imagine that the Value is a collection of other Key/Value elements. In brief, this is a kind of structure where Hashmaps are included in another Hashmap…</p>\n<p>Completely lost? Here are a the main elements Cassandra defined (this <a href=\"http://arin.me/blog/wtf-is-a-supercolumn-cassandra-data-model\">article</a> or the <a href=\"http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/DataModel\">Cassandra documentation</a> provide a more in depth view of the different types of structures you can have in Cassandra)<br />– <strong>Column</strong>. The basic element which is a tuple composed of a timestamp, a column name and a column value. The timestamp is set by the client and this has an architectural impact on clients’ clocks synchronization.<br />– <strong>SuperColumn</strong>. This structure is a little more complex. You can imagine it as a column in which can store a dynamic list of Columns.<br />– <strong>ColumnFamily</strong>: A set of columns. You can compare a ColumnFamily to a table in the relational world except the number and even (I am not sure this is the best idea but anyway) the names of columns can vary from a row to another. More important, the number of columns may vary during time (in the case for instance your schemas need to be upgraded etc…). Cassandra will not force any limitation in that case but your code will have to deal with these different schemas.<br />– <strong>KeySpaces</strong>: A set of ColumnFamily. Hence, the Keyspace configuration only defines (from the data modeling concern) the included ColumnFamily. The notion of “Row” does not exist by itself: this is a list of Columns or SuperColumns identified by a row key. </p>\n<h2>Data Partitioning and replication</h2>\n<p>Data Partitioning is one of tricky point. Depending on the studied tools, partitioning can be done either by the client library or by any node of the cluster and can be calculated using different algorithms (one of the most popular and reliable being the <a href=\"https://blog.octo.com/consistent-hashing-ou-l%E2%80%99art-de-distribuer-les-donnees/\">Consistent Hashing</a>.<br />Cassandra lets the nodes of the cluster (and not the client) partitioning the data based on the row key. Out of the box, Cassandra can nevertheless use <a href=\"http://ria101.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/cassandra-randompartitioner-vs-orderpreservingpartitioner/\">two different algorithms to distribute data over the nodes</a>. The first one is the RandomPartitionner and it gives you an equally and hash-based distribution. The second one is the OrderPreservingPartitioner and guarantees the Key are organized in a natural way. Thus, the latter facilitates the range queries since you need to hit fewer nodes to get all your ranges of data whereas the former has a better load balancing since the keys are more equally partitioned across the different nodes.<br />Then, each row (so all the Columns) is stored on the same physical node and columns are sorted based on their name. </p>\n<p>Moreover, and this is more linked to data replication, Cassandra natively enables replication across multiple datacenters and you can – by <a href=\"http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Operations\">configuration </a>– specify which nodes are in which Data Center. Hence, Cassandra would take care of replicating the data on at least one node in the distant Data Center (the partition-tolerant property of the CAP Theorem is so meaning full and I guess simpler to understand…). </p>\n<h2>Consistency management, conflict resolution and atomicity</h2>\n<p>NoSQL solutions like <a href=\"https://blog.octo.com/amazon-simpledb-le-harry-potter-de-voldemort/\">Voldemort </a>or <a href=\"http://incubator.apache.org/cassandra\">Cassandra </a>have chosen <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem\">Availability and Partition-tolerance over Consistency</a>. Thus, different strategy have been setting up: “Eventually Consistent”. </p>\n<p>Dealing with consistency is so a matter of dealing with data criticism and being able to define –for each data – the consistency level you need (based on the trade-offs the CAP Theorem imply). <strong>Cassandra defines different <a href=\"http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/API\">levels of consistency</a></strong> and I will not go into further details but here are a couple of them:<br />– <strong>ONE</strong>. Cassandra ensures the data is written to at least one node’s commit log and memory table before responding to the client. During read, the data will be returned from the first node where it is found. In that case, you must accept stale state because you have no warranty the node you hit to read the data has the last version of the data.<br />– <strong>QUORUM</strong>. In that case, Cassandra will write the data on /2 + 1 nodes before responding to the client (the Replication factor is the number of nodes the data will be replicated and is defined for a Keyspace). For the read, the data will be read on /2 + 1 nodes before returning the data. In that case, you are sure to get a consistent data (because N is smaller than R+W where N is the total number of nodes where the data is replicated, R the number of nodes where this data is being read and W the number of nodes the data is being written)<br />– <strong>ALL</strong>. In that case, Cassandra will write and read the data from all the nodes.</p>\n<p>Of course, at a given time, chances are high that each node has its own version of the data. Conflict resolution is made during the read requests (called <a href=\"http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/ReadRepair\">read-repair</a>) and the current version of Cassandra does not provide a Vector Clock conflict resolution mechanisms (should be available in the version 0.7). <strong>Conflict resolution is so based on timestamp</strong> (the one set when you insert the row or the column): the higher timestamp win and the node you are reading the data is responsible for that.<br />This is an important point because the timestamp is specified by the client, at the moment the column is inserted.<strong> Thus, all Cassandra clients’ need to be synchronized </strong>(based on an NTP for instance) in order to ensure the resolution conflict be reliable.</p>\n<p>Atomicity is also weaker than what we are used to in the relational world. <strong>Cassandra guarantees atomicity</strong> within a <a href=\"http://cassandra-user-incubator-apache-org.3065146.n2.nabble.com/Cassandra-guarantees-reads-and-writes-to-be-atomic-within-a-single-ColumnFamily-td4288141.html\">ColumnFamily</a> s<strong>o for all the columns of a row</strong>. </p>\n<h2>Elasticity</h2>\n<p>“Cassandra is liquid” would have written any marketer and to be honest, a lot of NoSQL solutions have been built upon this DNA. <strong>First of all, elasticity is at the data modeling level. Your data will live longer than your business rules and softness in the way your data schemas can evolve across the time is an interesting point</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>But elasticity is also about infrastructure and cluster sizing</strong>. Adding a new node to <a href=\"http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Operations\">Cassandra </a>is simple. Just turn on the AutoBootstrap property and specify at least one Seed of the current cluster. The node will hence be detected, added to the cluster and the data will be relocated (the needed time depends on the amount of data to transfer). Decommissioning a node is almost as simple as adding a node except you need to use the <a href=\"http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/NodeProbe\">nodetool utility</a> (which provides more options to visualize the streams between the nodes…) or a JMX command. </p>\n<h2>Cassandra monitoring</h2>\n<p>Cassandra runs on a JVM and exposes JMX properties. You can thus collecting monitoring information using jConsole or any JMX compliant tool. </p>\n<p>For instance, you can monitor<br />– Your nodes (which are part of the cluster, which are dead…)<br /><img src=\"https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/cassandra-jmonitoring.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"cassandra-jmonitoring\" width=\"609\" height=\"422\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11659\" srcset=\"https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/cassandra-jmonitoring.png 609w, https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/cassandra-jmonitoring-300x208.png 300w, https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/cassandra-jmonitoring-160x111.png 160w\" /></p>\n<p>– the streams between your nodes (especially in the case you added or removed nodes)<br />– Or stats. For instance, per-Column Family basic stats would be: Read Count, Read Latency, Write Count and Write Latency etc…</p>\n<p>More JMX plugins are available <a href=\"http://github.com/jbellis/cassandra-munin-plugins\">here</a> (provides graphs…) and <a href=\"http://nosql.mypopescu.com/post/611576467/cassandra-web-console\">some guys are developing web console</a>.</p>\n<h2>Access protocol</h2>\n<p>Cassandra is called using <a href=\"http://incubator.apache.org/thrift\">Thrift</a> (even if the 0.6 version introduced <a href=\"http://avro.apache.org\">Avro</a> protocol). As we told previously, Cassandra is responsible for routing the request to the proper node so you can reach any node of your cluster to serve your request. Nonetheless, <strong>the default thrift client API does not provide any load-balancing or connection pool mechanisms</strong>.<br />Concerning the connection pool, the main lacks, in my opinion, are (1) the capacity to close and reopen connections in case a node has failed, (2) the capacity to load-balance requests among all the nodes of the cluster and (3) the capacity to automatically request another node when the first attempt fails.<br />A higher level of load-balancing could be setup on the service layer</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/load-balancing.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"load-balancing\" width=\"639\" height=\"312\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11660\" srcset=\"https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/load-balancing.png 639w, https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/load-balancing-300x146.png 300w, https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/load-balancing-160x78.png 160w\" /></p>\n<p>Certain library (for instance <a href=\"http://prettyprint.me/2010/03/03/load-balancing-and-improved-failover-in-hector/\">Hector</a> in the Java World) provides connections pooling mechanisms and even kind of round-robin load balancing… </p>\n<p>In the next part, we will play in more details with Cassandra…</p>",

        "url": "https://www.instaclustr.com/securing-apache-cassandra-with-application-level-encryption/",
        "content": "<p>One topic that commonly comes up when discussing Cassandra with large enterprise clients is whether Cassandra can match feature X (audit logging, encryption at rest, column level security, etc) that is supported by Oracle, SQL Server or some other common enterprise RDBMS technology. In many cases, the answer to this question is no – Cassandra does not necessarily boast the same range of features (or, more unkindly, the same feature bloat) as leading RDBMS products.</p><p>However, enterprise security standards exist for good reasons and so it is necessary to present a solution which addresses these standards as part of the overall application solution. A key part of our answer to this question and best practice security in our view is to encrypt data as close to the point of collection and at latest, in the application layer.</p><p>We’re not alone in this viewpoint, Werner Vogels, CTO of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\">AWS</a> has said “We’ve got quite a few customers who’ve moved to 100% encryption. We really want to move our customers to a world where they own the keys and as such, they are the only ones who decide who has access to the data, not anybody else, not us as a provider.” <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-cto-werner-vogels-speaks-out-in-support-of-encryption-aws-apple-security-zero-knowledge-2016-3#5Kc318BRLzq2GhE5.99\">(Business Insider)</a></p><p>Encrypting data in the application layer of your application allows you to meet many typical enterprise database security standards while maintaining a horizontally scalable and highly available architecture. For example:</p><ul><li>Encryption at rest – data is encrypted before it’s even received by the database and so by definition will be encrypted at rest.</li> <li>Authorization and enterprise I&amp;AM integration – regardless of database level integration, applications will likely need to be integrated with enterprise I&amp;AM security providers to meet functional requirements. Once the application holds the keys to unlock the data, this integration can be leveraged to implement authorization requirements at whatever level of granularity is required. Data can even be encrypted using a key or password controlled by the end user, providing a very high guarantee of access restriction on the data.</li> <li>Access logging – applications are free to implement whatever access logging is required, along with potentially much richer context than is typically available at the database layer.</li> </ul><p>For those coming from a relational database background, encrypting the data in the application may seem like it comes with a functional cost that is hard to bear. However, in the context of the more restricted query model of Cassandra, the functional cost of encrypting at the application is very limited. Consider the following:</p><ul><li>Partition keys (the subset of the primary key column that is used to determine the distribution of data amongst the nodes): these keys are actually translated into a hash value by Cassandra and can therefore only be used for equality operators. Equality can be evaluated between encrypted values just as well as unencrypted so there is no impact here.</li> <li>Clustering keys (the remaining subset of the primary key after the partition key columns are taken out): clustering key columns impact the ordering of data on disk and can be used for range queries (&gt; and &lt;). Encrypting these columns can therefore reduce available query functionality (as values would need to be decrypted before being evaluated). However, by far the most common use case for range queries is querying on date ranges (for a series of events) and it is hard to think of many situations where dates themselves are sensitive once any associated identifying data is encrypted.</li> <li>Non-key values: Cassandra does not (except with “allow filtering” which is generally not recommended) allow filtering on non-key columns. Non-key data can therefore be encrypted without any real loss in functionality. The one possible loss is if you want to use Cassandra aggregation to; for example, calculate a sum of values. Again, it’s hard to think of a situation where the value you are going to calculate a sum on is sensitive once identifying data is encrypted. The exception to this, which requires closer examination, is if you are planning on using secondary index search technology such as the <a href=\"https://lucene.apache.org/core/\">Lucene index</a> or <a href=\"http://spark.apache.org/\">Apache Spark</a> to access your data. In many cases, careful consideration of application design and what to encrypt can resolve these limitations.</li> </ul><p>There are many ways you can implement this encryption – including standard encryption libraries (<a href=\"http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-crypto/\">Apache Commons Crypto</a>) called by wrapper classes in your code or a driver that supports encryption such as that provided by our partner <a href=\"http://www.baffle.io\">baffle.io</a>.</p><p>In summary, we believe that encrypting as close as possible to the point of data collection, rather than trying to protect it at many points in your application stack is definitely the best approach to protect your data. With <a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/managed/cassandra/\">Apache Cassandra</a>, the cost you pay for implementing this encryption may not be as significant as it first seems.</p>",

        "url": "https://www.snappydata.io/blog/snappydata-memsql-cassandra-a-performance-benchmark",
        "content": "<p>There is a repo associated with this blog post <a href=\"https://github.com/SnappyDataInc/snappy-poc\">here</a></p><p>There is a blog post that explains the Ad Analytics code example used below <a href=\"http://www.snappydata.io/blog/ad-analytics-using-spark-streaming-and-snappydata-code-example\">here</a></p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>We recently released a mixed workload example for Ad Analytics (<a href=\"https://github.com/SnappyDataInc/snappy-poc\">description and source code on github</a>) to illustrate the simplicity of development using SQL or the Spark Dataframe API in SnappyData. By mixed workload we mean a system that that is continuously ingesting a high velocity stream of ad impressions while concurrently serving ad-hoc interactive queries.  In addition to demonstrating SnappyData’s simplicity, we wanted to also benchmark it against alternatives. Here we try to understand SnappyData’s performance compared to alternate “lambda” stacks -  <a href=\"https://github.com/datastax/spark-cassandra-connector\">Cassandra + Spark</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/memsql/memsql-spark-connector\">MemSQL + Spark</a> for both stream ingestion rate and interactive analytic query performance.</p><p>Our summarized findings:<br />- Snappydata can ingest data <strong>twice as fast</strong> as Cassandra and <strong>1.5 times faster</strong> than MemSQL.<br />- While ingesting data, SnappyData can concurrently execute analytics class queries <strong>45 times faster</strong> than Cassandra and <strong>3 times faster</strong> than MemSQL.</p><p>Note that these numbers represent queries over exact datasets; they do not include SnappyData’s <a href=\"https://github.com/SnappyDataInc/snappydata/blob/master/docs/aqp.md\">Approximate Query Processing techniques</a>. When these techniques are used (and the data volumes have grown), query latency becomes multiple orders of magnitude faster. The source code used for these tests is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/SnappyDataInc/snappy-poc\">Github</a>. Below, we will describe the benchmark:</p><h2>Machine Configuration</h2><p>Five ‘c4.2xlarge’ Compute optimized EC2 instances with<br />-       8 Cores<br />-       15GB RAM<br />-       Dedicated EBS bandwidth of 1000 Mbps</p><p>Product versions used:<br />MemSQL<br />-       MemSQL Ops-4.1.11 Community Edition<br />-       Spark-MemSQL Connector 2.10_1.3.2<br />-       Spark 1.5.2<br />Cassandra<br />-       Cassandra 3.5<br />-       Spark-Cassandra Connector 2.10_1.6.0-M2<br />-       Spark 1.6.0<br />-       SnappyData<br />-       SnappyData 0.3-PREVIEW; with Spark 1.6.1 is bundled<br />-       Apache Kafka 2.10_0.8.2.2.</p><h2>Architecture</h2><p>One machine was used for the Spark Master while the other four were used as Workers. A single Kafka producer process was executed producing ad impressions (asynchronously) over 16 threads. Four Kafka brokers were collocated on the Spark Worker nodes. We used 32 Kafka partitions to maximize concurrent processing. The kafka producer uses Avro Java objects to represent AdImpressions. Each AdImpression, when serialized, has a payload size of 63 bytes. To allow for concurrent analytical queries we configured spark so enough cores were available for query processing.</p><p>Finally, each tested system used the highest version of Spark it supported: 1.6.1 for SnappyData, 1.6.0 for Cassandra and 1.5.2 for MemSQL.</p><p>For each store that supported columnar storage, we used a column store to support fast scans and aggregations. Data is ingested using the Kafka direct receiver available with Spark Streaming and ingested in parallel on each partition.</p><p>The figures below depict the benchmark architecture for all 3 product configurations. The only difference with SnappyData is that its store is fully collocated with the spark executors as depicted in the figure <a href=\"https://github.com/SnappyDataInc/snappydata/blob/master/docs/GettingStarted.md#snappydata-cluster-explanation\">here</a>. SnappyData completely avoids the need to shuffle data as its column store defaults to the partitioning used by the upstream RDD (Spark DStream in this case) resulting in better speed of ingestion and query performance.</p><h4>SnappyData</h4><p>We ran the locator and the lead node (which runs the Spark Driver and is the cluster master) on one server and used the remaining four to parallel ingest from kafka and store into the column table (both in-memory and on disk). </p><p class=\"block-img\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://snappyblog.cdn.prismic.io/snappyblog/8d7eb75c15c29dbbc4a314a9a49f27d157068399_screen-shot-2016-06-20-at-9.32.23-am.png\" width=\"623\" height=\"251\" /></p><h4>Spark-Cassandra</h4><p>Similar to SnappyData we run the spark master/Driver on one node and so the ingestion process on the remaining 4 AWS nodes.</p><p class=\"block-img\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://snappyblog.cdn.prismic.io/snappyblog/7e6edd43fd86117512f23b7772a6b7d8d7802673_screen-shot-2016-06-20-at-9.33.50-am.png\" width=\"652\" height=\"259\" /></p><h4>Spark-MemSQL</h4><p>Matching what we did for SnappyData we start the spark master/Driver along with the MemSQL aggregator on one node and the remaining nodes parallely ingest and store into a local column table in MemSQL.</p><p class=\"block-img\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://snappyblog.cdn.prismic.io/snappyblog/1349f4125003c60731d1bf1fc3177571449619de_screen-shot-2016-06-20-at-9.36.21-am.png\" width=\"637\" height=\"277\" /></p><h4>Cassandra Tuning</h4><p>To tune writes, the cassandra connector batches incoming writes and exposes several <a href=\"https://github.com/datastax/spark-cassandra-connector/blob/master/doc/reference.md#write-tuning-parameters\">tuning parameters</a>. The ones we adjusted are listed above. Given the number of cores in use, adjusting the concurrent writer count gave us the maximum throughput. By default, the connector retains up to 1000 batches per single Spark task in memory before writing to Cassandra. This configuration is inappropriate in a production scenario unless checkpointing is enabled in Spark Streaming. While we didn’t tune any memory setting in the Cassandra servers we ensured that enough memory was available on each node to ensure all the data will be cached in the OS page cache.</p><h4>MemSQL Tuning</h4><p>We used defaults for the MemSQL configuration.</p><h4>SnappyData Tuning</h4><p>We used defaults for  SnappyData configuration.</p><h2>Ingestion Performance</h2><p>To ingest data we used the Spark streaming Kafka direct receiver. This is the most optimal way to fetch from kafka – batches from the topic are directly processed by the stream without any additional buffering in the Spark layer.</p><p>For all three products, each incoming Avro message is first decoded and then turned into a Spark Row object before it is stored into their respective Column table (in-memory + disk persistent). Below is the code snippet used to store streaming data into a column table in SnappyData.</p><p>In the Cassandra case, we ingest into a table with no replication (i.e. replication factor 1) so it is equivalent to Snappydata.</p><p>In the MemSQL case, we created the equivalent column table: </p><p>And stored the incoming streaming data into the coulmn table:</p><p>The chart below shows the ingestion per second throughput after some warm up period.</p><p class=\"block-img\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://snappyblog.cdn.prismic.io/snappyblog/ebb7f21a126788e0cec4567624f3f56a57677008_screen-shot-2016-06-20-at-10.34.20-am.png\" width=\"615\" height=\"422\" /></p><p>In short, on 4 nodes with 8 cores and a capped CPU (to leave space for concurrent OLAP queries), <strong>SnappyData outperformed Spark-Cassandra by roughly 2x</strong> with 670,000 events per second versus 322,000 <strong>and outperformed MemSQL by roughly 1.5x</strong> with 670,000 vs 480,000.</p><h2>Concurrent Query workload</h2><p>We concurrently execute simple aggregation queries using the Spark SQL Driver program when the ingested data reaches 30, 60 and 90 million records. We logged the query execution time to a file. For example, you can see the driver program for Cassandra <a href=\"https://github.com/SnappyDataInc/snappy-poc/blob/master/spark-cassandra/src/main/scala/io/snappydata/benchmark/CassandraQueryPerf.scala\">here</a>. We used following three aggregation queries to measure OLAP performance.</p><p><strong>Q1 </strong>: Show top 20 Geos with the highest ad impressions<br /><em>select count(*) AS adCount, geo from adImpressions group by geo order by adCount desc limit 20;</em></p><p><strong>Q2</strong>: Geos with the highest total bid<br /><em>select sum (bid) as max_bid, geo from adImpressions group by geo order by max_bid desc limit 20;</em></p><p><strong>Q3</strong>: Top 20 publishers with the highest bid total<br /><em>select sum (bid) as max_bid, publisher from adImpressions group by publisher order by max_bid desc limit 20;  \t</em></p><p>The following chart shows the latency numbers for each query by product and row count.</p><p class=\"block-img\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://snappyblog.cdn.prismic.io/snappyblog/599e09a972a440ddd78296f4f3e9ecc89992d308_screen-shot-2016-06-20-at-10.48.42-am.png\" width=\"674\" height=\"482\" /></p><p>As you can see SnappyData outperforms Spark-Cassandra by roughly <strong>45 times</strong> when executing queries while also ingesting data and outperforms MemSQL by roughly <strong>3 times</strong> on the same setup.</p><h2>Analysis</h2><p>The Cassandra connector suffers from two problems: <br />- The full data has to be serialized and copied to the spark cluster including going through format conversions for each query and <br />- The data has to be shuffled across multiple partitions.</p><p>These issues add latency to both ingestion and query performance.</p><p>The MemSQL connector, on the other hand, attempts to push as much of the query as possible to MemSQL which provides significant savings in having to move large quantities of data into Spark for each query. Go through <a href=\"https://github.com/memsql/memsql-spark-connector/blob/master/connectorLib/src/main/scala/com/memsql/spark/pushdown/MemSQLPushdownStrategy.scala\">MemSQLPushdownStrategy</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/memsql/memsql-spark-connector/blob/master/connectorLib/src/main/scala/com/memsql/spark/pushdown/MemSQLPhysicalRDD.scala\">MemSQLPhysicalRDD</a> for details. The other optimization in MemSQL is that it always attempts to collocate its partition to the parent, so, kafka partitions, queuing, and ingestion all occur without ever having to shuffle any records.</p><p>SnappyData embeds its column store alongside the Spark executors providing reference level access to rows. Similar to MemSQL, it also ensures that each partition in the store layer, by default, uses the parent’s partitioning method. i.e. there is no need to shuffle during storing. When queried, the data is column compressed and formatted in the same format as Spark (when cached or persisted). These features provide a significant performance boost in ingestion and query latency.</p><h2>Interactive Query response with AQP</h2><p>We also benchmarked SnappyData’s <a href=\"https://github.com/SnappyDataInc/snappydata/blob/master/docs/aqp.md\">Approximate Query Processing</a> techniques and compared this to “exact” queries against our in-memory column tables. While these sampling techniques require large data volumes for higher accuracy, we compensated by creating a relatively large <a href=\"http://snappydatainc.github.io/snappydata/aqp/#approximations-technique-2-sampling\">stratified sample</a> of 3% to work with smaller data sets in this example. We created a <a href=\"https://github.com/SnappyDataInc/snappy-poc/blob/master/src/main/scala/io/snappydata/adanalytics/SnappySQLLogAggregator.scala#L99\">sample on the base column Table</a>. When queries are executed we append an error clause so the sample is automatically consulted (<em>‘select .. from aggrAdImpressions group by … <em><strong>with error 0.2’</strong></em>). Let’s compare our 3 queries over the exact table and sample table (In SnappyData) at 350m, 400m and 450m records with concurrent streaming. </em></p><p class=\"block-img\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://snappyblog.cdn.prismic.io/snappyblog/63c512965721478575757c303bbceb2057422a84_screen-shot-2016-06-21-at-8.59.03-am.png\" width=\"421\" height=\"315\" /></p><p>As expected, the sample table execution is much faster than its counterpart exact table. While the performance is high, usually with large data sets the sample fraction can be much smaller with a resulting performance difference that is 2 or even 3 orders of magnitude better than running against the base table. It is also interesting to note that, <strong>with increasing data volume, the query execution time on the sample stays fairly constant</strong>. While the sample size grows in proportion to the base table size, most of the query execution cost comes from other sources like error computation and query planning through the spark driver.

At its core, it has a batch design center and is capable of working with disparate data sources. While this provides rich unified access to data, this can also be quite inefficient and expensive. Analytic processing requires massive data sets to be repeatedly copied and data to be reformatted to suit Spark. In many cases, it ultimately fails to deliver the promise of interactive analytic performance.\nFor instance, each time an aggregation is run on a large Cassandra table, it necessitates streaming the entire table into Spark to do the aggregation. Caching within Spark is immutable and results in stale insight.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"user-content-the-snappydata-approach\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#the-snappydata-approach\"></a>The SnappyData Approach</h3>\n<p>At SnappyData, we take a very different approach. SnappyData fuses a low latency, highly available in-memory transactional database (GemFireXD) into Spark with shared memory management and optimizations. Data in the highly available in-memory store is laid out using the same columnar format as Spark (Tungsten). All query engine operators are significantly more optimized through better vectorization and code generation. <br />The net effect is, an order of magnitude performance improvement when compared to native Spark caching, and more than two orders of magnitude better Spark performance when working with external data sources.</p>\n<p>Essentially, we turn Spark into an in-memory operational database capable of transactions, point reads, writes, working with Streams (Spark) and running analytic SQL queries. Or, it is an in-memory scale out Hybrid Database that can execute Spark code, SQL or even Objects.</p>\n<p>If you are already using Spark, experience 20x speed up for your query performance.

Users thinking of Cassandra as an event store and source/sink for machine learning / modeling / classification would also benefit greatly from this post.</p><p>Two key questions when considering analytics systems are:</p>\n<ol><li>How much storage do I need (to buy)?</li>\n\t<li>How fast can my questions get answered?</li>\n</ol><p>I conducted a performance study, comparing different storage layouts, caching, indexing, filtering, and other options in Cassandra (including <a href=\"https://github.com/tuplejump/FiloDB\">FiloDB</a>), plus <a href=\"https://parquet.apache.org/\">Apache Parquet</a>, the modern gold standard for analytics storage. All comparisons were done using Spark SQL. More importantly than determining data modeling versus storage format versus row cache or DeflateCompressor, I hope this post gives you a useful framework for predicting storage cost and query speeds for your own applications.</p>\n<p>I was initially going to title this post, “Cassandra vs Hadoop,” but honestly, this post is not about Hadoop or Parquet at all. Let me get this out of the way, however, because many people, in their evaluations of different technologies, are going to think about one technology stack versus another. Which is better for which use cases? Is it possible to lower total cost of ownership (TCO) by having just one stack for everything? Answering the storage and query cost questions are part of this analysis. To be transparent, I am the author of FiloDB. While I do have much more vested on one side of this debate, I will focus on the analysis and let you draw your own conclusions. However, I hope you will realize that Cassandra is not just a key-value store; it can be—and is being—used for big data analytics, and it can be very competitive in both query speeds and storage costs.</p>\n<h2>Wide spectrum of storage costs and query speeds</h2>\n<p>Figure 1 summarizes different Cassandra storage options, plus Parquet. Farther to the right denotes higher storage densities, and higher up the chart denotes faster query speeds. In general, you want to see something in the upper right corner.</p>\n<figure id=\"id-68jin\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"iimagessized_figure-1_storagecostsquerychartjpg\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Sized_Figure-1_StorageCostsQueryChart-ba2a9cf05af2b129995fa229565184b3.jpg\" /><figcaption>Figure 1. Graphic summarizing storage cost vs. query speed in Cassandra and Parquet.

Keep in mind that the chart above has a log scale on both axes. Also, while this article will go into the tradeoffs and details about different options in depth, we will not be covering the many other factors people will choose CQL tables for, such as support for modeling maps, sets, lists, custom types, and many other things.</p>\n<h2>Summary of methodology for analysis</h2>\n<p>Query speed was computed by averaging the response times for three different queries:</p>\n<pre>\ndf.select(count(“numarticles”)).show\n</pre>\n<pre>\nSELECT Actor1Name, AVG(AvgTone) as tone FROM gdelt GROUP BY Actor1Name ORDER BY tone DESC\n</pre>\n<pre>\nSELECT AVG(avgtone), MIN(avgtone), MAX(avgtone) FROM gdelt WHERE monthyear=198012\n</pre>\n<p>The first query is an all-table-scan simple count. The second query measures a grouping aggregation. And the third query is designed to test filtering performance with a record count of 43.4K items, or roughly 1% of the original data set. The data set used for each query is the <a href=\"http://www.gdeltproject.org/\">GDELT</a> public data set: 1979-1984, 57 columns x 4.16 million rows, recording geopolitical events worldwide. The source code for ingesting the Cassandra tables and instructions for reproducing the queries are available in my <a href=\"http://github.com/velvia/cassandra-gdelt\">cassandra-gdelt repo</a>.</p>\n<p>The storage cost for Cassandra tables is computed by running compaction first, then taking the size of all stable files in the data folder of the tables.</p>\n<p>To make the Cassandra CQL tables more performant, shorter column names were used (for example, <code>a2code</code> instead of <code>Actor2Code</code>).</p>\n<p>All tests were run on my Macbook Pro 15” Mid-2015, SSD / 16GB. Specifics are as follows:</p>\n<ul><li>Cassandra 2.1.6 installed using CCM</li>\n\t<li>Spark 1.4.0 except where noted, run with master = ‘local[1]’ and spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=4</li>\n\t<li>Spark-Cassandra-Connector 1.4.0-M3</li>\n</ul><p>Running all the tests essentially single threaded was done partly out of simplicity and partly to form a basis for modeling performance behavior (see the modeling query performance section below).</p>\n<h2>Scan speeds are dominated by storage format</h2>\n<p>OK, let’s dive into details! The key to analytics query performance is the <em>scan speed</em>, or how many records you can scan per unit time. This is true for whole table scans, and it is true when you filter data, as we’ll see later. Figure 2 below shows the data for all query times, which are whole table scans, with relative speed factors for easier digestion:</p>\n<figure id=\"FIG2\" class=\"full\"><img alt=\"query times with relative speed factors\" class=\"iimagesfigure-2_updatedjpg\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure-2_updated-302cecf8e0282d0371fba4d8ebd01c8b.jpg\" /><figcaption>Figure 2. All query times with relative speed factors. All query times run on Spark 1.4/1.5 with local[1]; C* 2.1.6 w/ 512MB row cache. Image courtesy of Evan Chan.</figcaption></figure><p>NOTE: to get more accurate scan speeds, one needs to subtract the baseline latency in Spark, but this is left out for simplicity. This actually slightly disfavors the fastest contestants.</p>\n<p>Cassandra’s COMPACT STORAGE gains an order-of-magnitude improvement in scan speeds simply due to more efficient storage. FiloDB and Parquet gain another order of magnitude due to a columnar layout, which allows reading only the columns needed for analysis, plus more efficient columnar blob compression. Thus, storage format makes the biggest difference in scan speeds. More details are below, but for regular CQL tables, the scan speed should be inversely proportional to the number of columns in each record, assuming simple data types (not collections).</p>\n<p>Part of the speed advantage of FiloDB over Parquet has to do with the InMemory option. You could argue this is not fair; however, when you read Parquet files repeatedly, most of that file is most likely in the OS Cache anyway. Yes, having in-memory data is a bigger advantage for networked reads from Cassandra, but I think part of the speed increase is because FiloDB’s columnar format is optimized more for CPU efficiency, rather than compact size. Also, when you cache Parquet files, you are caching an entire file or blocks thereof, compressed and encoded; FiloDB relies on small chunks, which can be much more efficiently cached (on a per-column basis, and allows for updates). Folks at Databricks have repeatedly told me that caching Parquet files in-memory did not result in significant speed gains, and this makes sense due to the format and compression.</p>\n<p>Wide row CQL tables are actually less efficient than narrow row due to additional overhead of clustering column name prefixing. Spark’s cacheTable should be nearly as efficient as the other fast solutions, but suffers from partitioning issues.</p>\n<h2>Storage efficiency generally correlates with scan speed</h2>\n<p>In <a href=\"#FIG2\">Figure 2</a>, you can see that these technologies list in the same order for storage efficiency as for scan speeds, and that’s not an accident. Storing tables as COMPACT STORAGE and FiloDB yields a roughly 7-8.5x improvement in storage efficiency over regular CQL tables for this data set. Less I/O = faster scans!</p>\n<p>Cassandra CQL wide row tables are less efficient, and you’ll see why in a minute. Moving from LZ4 to Deflate compression reduces storage footprint by 38% for FiloDB and 50% for the wide row CQL tables, so it’s definitely worth considering. DeflateCompressor actually sped up wide row CQL scans by 15%, but slowed down the single partition query slightly.</p>\n<h3>Why Cassandra CQL tables are inefficient</h3>\n<p>Let’s say a Cassandra CQL table has a primary key that looks like (pk, ck1, ck2, ck3) and other columns designated c1, c2, c3, c4 for creativity. This is what the physical layout looks like for one partition (“physical row”):</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><td>Column header</td>\n\t\t\t<td>ck1:ck2:ck3:c1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>ck1:ck2:ck3:c2</td>\n\t\t\t<td>ck1:ck2:ck3:c3</td>\n\t\t\t<td>ck1:ck2:ck3:c4</td>\n\t\t\t<td>ck1:ck2:ck3a:c1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>ck1:ck2:ck3a:c2</td>\n\t\t\t<td>ck1:ck2:ck3a:c3</td>\n\t\t\t<td>ck1:ck2:ck3a:c4</td>\n\t\t</tr><tr><td>pk : value</td>\n\t\t\t<td>v1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>v2</td>\n\t\t\t<td>v3</td>\n\t\t\t<td>v4</td>\n\t\t\t<td>v1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>v2</td>\n\t\t\t<td>v3</td>\n\t\t\t<td>v4</td>\n\t\t</tr></tbody></table><p>Cassandra offers ultimate flexibility in terms of updating any part of a record, as well as inserting into collections, but the price paid is that each column of every record is stored in its own cell, with a very lengthy column header consisting of the entire clustering key, plus the name of each column. If you have 100 columns in your table (very common for data warehouse fact tables), then the clustering key <em>ck1:ck2:ck3</em> is repeated 100 times. It is true that compression helps a lot with this, but not enough. Cassandra 3.x has a new, trimmer storage engine that does away with many of these inefficiencies, at a reported space savings of up to 4x.</p>\n<p>COMPACT STORAGE is the way that most of us who used Cassandra prior to CQL stored our data: as one blob per record. It is extremely efficient. That model looks like this:</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><td>Column header</td>\n\t\t\t<td>ck1:ck2:ck3</td>\n\t\t\t<td>ck1:ck2:ck3a</td>\n\t\t</tr><tr><td>pk</td>\n\t\t\t<td>value1_blob</td>\n\t\t\t<td>value2_blob</td>\n\t\t</tr></tbody></table><p>You lose features such as secondary indexing, but you can still model your data for efficient lookups by partition key and range scans of clustering keys.</p>\n<p>FiloDB, on the other hand, stores data by grouping columns together, and then by clumping data from many rows into its own efficient blob format. The layout looks like this:</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><th> </th>\n\t\t\t<th colspan=\"2\">Column 1</th>\n\t\t\t<th colspan=\"2\">Column 2</th>\n\t\t</tr><tr><td>pk</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Chunk 1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Chunk 2</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Chunk 1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Chunk 2</td>\n\t\t</tr></tbody></table><p>Columnar formats minimize I/O for analytical queries, which select a small subset of the original data. They also tend to remain compact even in-memory. FiloDB’s internal format is designed for fast random access without the need to deserialize. On the other hand, Parquet is designed for very fast linear scans, but most encoding types require the entire page of data to be deserialized—thus, filtering will incur higher I/O costs.</p>\n<h2>A formula for modeling query performance</h2>\n<p>We can model the query time for a single query using a simple formula:</p>\n<p>Predicted queryTime = Expected number of records / (# cores * scan speed)</p>\n<p>Basically, the query time is proportional to how much data you are querying, and inversely proportional to your resources and raw scan speed. Note that the scan speed above is single-core scan speed, such as was measured using my benchmarking methodology. Keep this model in mind when thinking about storage formats, data modeling, filtering, and other effects.</p>\n<h2>Can caching help? A little bit.</h2>\n<p>If storage size leads partially to slow scan speeds, what about taking advantage of caching options to reduce I/O? Great idea. Let’s review the different options.</p>\n<ul><li>Cassandra row cache: I tried row cache of 512MB for the narrow CQL table use case—512MB was picked as it was a quarter of the size of the data set on disk. Most of the time your data won’t fit in cache. This increased scan speed for the narrow CQL table by 29%. If you tend to access data at the beginning of your partitions, row cache could be a huge win. What I like best about this option is that it’s really easy to use and brain-dead simple, and it works with your changing data.</li>\n\t<li>DSE has an <a href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/datastax_enterprise/4.8/datastax_enterprise/inmem/inmemTOC.html\">in-memory tables</a> feature. Think of it, basically, as keeping your SSTables in-memory instead of on disk. It seems to me to be slower than row cache (since you still have to decompress the tables), and I’ve been told it’s not useful for most people.</li>\n\t<li>Finally, in Spark SQL you can cache your tables (CACHE TABLE in spark-sql, sqlContext.cacheTable in spark-shell) in an on-heap, in-memory columnar format. It is really fast (44x speedup over base case above), but suffers from multiple problems: the entire table has to be cached, it cannot be updated, and it is not HA (once any executor or the app dies, ka-boom!). Furthermore, you have to decide what to cache, and the initial read from Cassandra is still really slow.</li>\n</ul><p>None of the above options are anywhere close to the wins that better storage format and effective data modeling will give you. As my analysis shows, FiloDB, without caching, is faster than all Cassandra caching options. Of course, if you are loading data from different data centers or constantly doing network shuffles, then caching can be a big boost, but most Spark on Cassandra setups are collocated.</p>\n<h2>The Future: Optimizing for CPU, not I/O</h2>\n<p>For Spark queries over regular Cassandra tables, I/O dominates CPU due to the storage format. This is why the storage format makes such a big difference, and also why technologies like SSD have dramatically boosted Cassandra performance. Due to the dominance of I/O costs over CPU, it may be worth it to compress data more. For formats like Parquet and FiloDB, which are already optimized for fast scans and minimized I/O, it is the opposite—the CPU cost of querying data actually dominates over I/O. That’s why the Spark folks are working on code-gen and <a href=\"https://databricks.com/blog/2015/04/28/project-tungsten-bringing-spark-closer-to-bare-metal.html\">Project Tungsten</a>.</p>\n<p>If you look at the latest trends, memory is getting cheaper; NVRAM, 3DRAM, and very cheap persistent DRAM technologies promise to make I/O bandwidth no longer an issue. This trend obliterates decades of database design based on the assumption that I/O is much, much slower than CPU, and instead favors CPU-efficient storage formats. With the increase in IOPs, optimizing for linear reads is no longer quite as important.</p>\n<h2>Filtering and data modeling</h2>\n<p>Remember our formula for predicting query performance:</p>\n<p>Predicted queryTime = Expected number of records / (# cores * scan speed)</p>\n<p>Correct data modeling in Cassandra deals with the first part of that equation—enabling fast lookups by reducing the number of records that need to be looked up. Denormalization, writing summaries instead of raw data, and being smart about data modeling all help reduce the number of records. Partition and clustering key filtering are definitely the most effective filtering mechanisms in Cassandra. Keep in mind, though, that scan speeds are still really important, even for filtered data—unless you are really doing just single-key lookups.</p>\n<p>Look back at <a href=\"#FIG2\">Figure 2</a>. What do you see? Using partition key filtering on wide row CQL tables proved very effective—100x faster than scanning the whole wide row table on 1% of the data (a direct plugin in the formula of reducing the number of records to 1% of original). However, since wide rows are a bit inefficient compared to narrow tables, some speed is lost. You can also see in Figure 2 that scan speeds still matter. FiloDB’s in-memory execution of that same filtered query was still 100x faster than the Cassandra CQL table version—taking only 30 <em>milliseconds</em> as opposed to nearly three seconds. Will this matter? For serving concurrent, Web-speed queries it will certainly matter.</p>\n<p>Note that I only modeled a very simple equals predicate, but in reality, many people need much more flexible predicate patterns. Due to the restrictive predicates available for partition keys (= only for all columns except last one, which can be IN), modeling with regular CQL tables will probably require multiple tables, one each to match different predicate patterns. (This is being addressed in C* 2.2 a bit, maybe more in 3.x) This needs to be accounted for in the storage cost and TOC analysis. One way around this is to store custom index tables, which allows application-side custom scan patterns. FiloDB uses this technique to provide arbitrary filtering of partition keys.</p>\n<p>Some notes on the filtering and data modeling aspect of my analysis:</p>\n<ul><li>The narrow rows layout in CQL is one record per partition key, thus partition key filtering does not apply. See discussion of secondary indices below.</li>\n\t<li>Cached tables in Spark SQL, as of Spark 1.5, only does whole table scans. There might be some improvements coming, though—see <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-4849\">SPARK-4849</a> in Spark 1.6.</li>\n\t<li>FiloDB has roughly the same filtering capabilities as Cassandra—by partition key and clustering key—but improvements on the partition key filtering capabilities of C are planned.</li>\n\t<li>It is possible to partition your Parquet files and selectively read them, and it is supposedly possible to sort your files to take advantage of intra-file filtering. That takes extra effort, and since I haven’t heard of anyone doing the intra-file sort, I deemed it outside the scope of this study. Even if you were to do this, the filtering would not be anywhere near as granular as is possible with Cassandra and FiloDB—of course, your comments and enlightenment are welcome here.</li>\n</ul><h2>Cassandra’s secondary indices usually not worth it</h2>\n<p>How do secondary indices in Cassandra perform? Let’s test that with two count queries with a WHERE clause on Actor1CountryCode, a low cardinality field with a hugely varying number of records in our portion of the GDELT data set:</p>\n<ul><li>WHERE Actor1CountryCode = ‘USA’: 378k records (9.1% of records)</li>\n\t<li>WHERE Actor1CountryCode = ‘ALB’: 5005 records (0.1% of records)</li>\n</ul><table><tbody><tr><th> </th>\n\t\t\t<th>Large country</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Small country</th>\n\t\t\t<th>2i Scan Rate</th>\n\t\t</tr><tr><td>Narrow CQL Table</td>\n\t\t\t<td>28s / 6.6x</td>\n\t\t\t<td>0.7s / 264x</td>\n\t\t\t<td>13.5k records/sec</td>\n\t\t</tr><tr><td>CQL Wide Rows</td>\n\t\t\t<td>143s / 1.9x</td>\n\t\t\t<td>2.7s / 103x</td>\n\t\t\t<td>2643 records/sec</td>\n\t\t</tr></tbody></table><p>If secondary indices were perfectly efficient, one would expect query times to reduce linearly with the drop in the number of records. Alas, this is not so. For the CountryCode = USA query, one would expect a speedup of around 11x, but secondary indices proved very inefficient, especially in the wide rows case. Why is that? Because for wide rows, Cassandra has to do a lot of point lookups on the same partition, which is very inefficient and results in only a small drop in the I/O required (in fact, much more random I/O), compared to a full table scan.</p>\n<p>Secondary indices work well only when the number of records is reduced to such a small amount that the inefficiencies do not matter and Cassandra can skip most partitions. There are also other operational issues with secondary indices, and they are not recommended for use when the cardinality goes above 50,000 items or so.</p>\n<h2>Predicting your own data’s query performance</h2>\n<p>How should you measure the performance of your own data and hardware? It’s really simple, actually:</p>\n<ol><li>Measure your scan speed for your base Cassandra CQL table. Number of records / time to query, single threaded</li>\n\t<li>Use the formula earlier—Predicted queryTime = Expected number of records / (# cores * scan speed)</li>\n\t<li>Use relative speed factors above for predictions</li>\n</ol><p>The relative factors above are based on the GDELT data set with 57 columns. The more columns you have (data warehousing applications commonly have hundreds of columns), the greater you can expect the scan speed boost for FiloDB and Parquet. (Again, this is because, unlike for regular CQL/row-oriented layouts, columnar layouts are generally insensitive to the number of columns.) It is true that concurrency (within a single query) leads to its own inefficiencies, but in my experience, that is more like a 2x slowdown, and not the order-of-magnitude differences we are modeling here.</p>\n<p>User concurrency can be modeled by dividing the number of available cores by the number of users. You can easily see that in FAIR scheduling mode, Spark will actually schedule multiple queries at the same time (but be sure to modify fair-scheduler.xml appropriately). Thus, the formula becomes:</p>\n<p>Predicted queryTime = Expected number of records * # users / (# cores * scan speed)</p>\n<p>There is an important case where the above formula needs to be modified, and that is for single-partition queries (for example, where you have a WHERE clause with an exact match for all partition keys, and Spark pushes down the predicate to Cassandra). The above formula assumes that the queries are spread over the number of nodes you have, but this is not true for single-partition queries. In that case, there are two possibilities:</p>\n<ol><li>The number of users is less than the number of available cores. Then, the query time = number_of_records / scan_speed.</li>\n\t<li>The number of users is &gt;= the number of available cores. In that case, the work is divided amongst each core, so the original query time formula works again.</li>\n</ol><h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Apache Cassandra is one of the most widely used, proven, and robust distributed databases in the modern big data era. The good news is that there are multiple options for using it in an efficient manner for ad-hoc, batch, time-series analytics applications.</p>\n<p>For (multiple) order-of-magnitude improvements in query and storage performance, consider the storage format carefully, and model your data to take advantage of partition and clustering key filtering/predicate pushdowns. Both effects can be combined for maximum advantage—using FiloDB plus filtering data improved a three-minute CQL table scan to sub-100ms response times. Secondary indices are helpful only if they filter your data down to, say, 1% or less—and even then, consider them carefully. Row caching, compression, and other options offer smaller advantages up to about 2x.</p>\n<p>If you need a lot of individual record updates, or lookups by individual record, but don’t mind creating your own blob format, the COMPACT STORAGE / single column approach could work really well. If you need fast analytical query speeds with updates, fine-grained filtering and a Web-speed in-memory option, FiloDB could be a good bet. If the formula above shows that regular Cassandra tables, laid out with the best data modeling techniques applied, are good enough for your use case, kudos to you!</p>\n        \n                  \n        \n                  <div class=\"image-credit\">\n  Article image: Portland General Electric's Salem Smart Power Center includes a large-scale energy storage system.\n          \n                  (source: <a class=\"secondary\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/portlandgeneralelectric/8905201835\">Portland General Electric on Flickr</a>).\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    \n</div>",

The driver is built\nwith maintainability and code readability in mind first and then performance and features, as such every now and then performance\nmay degrade, if this occurs please report and issue and it will be looked at and remedied. The only time the driver copies data from\nits read buffer is when it Unmarshal's data into supplied types.</p>\n<p>Some tips for getting more performance from the driver:</p>\n<ul><li>Use the TokenAware policy</li>\n<li>Use many goroutines when doing inserts, the driver is asynchronous but provides a synchronous API, it can execute many queries concurrently</li>\n<li>Tune query page size</li>\n<li>Reading data from the network to unmarshal will incur a large amount of allocations, this can adversely affect the garbage collector, tune <code>GOGC</code></li>\n<li>Close iterators after use to recycle byte buffers</li>\n</ul><h2><a id=\"user-content-important-default-keyspace-changes\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#important-default-keyspace-changes\"></a>Important Default Keyspace Changes</h2>\n<p>gocql no longer supports executing \"use \" statements to simplify the library. The user still has the\nability to define the default keyspace for connections but now the keyspace can only be defined before a\nsession is created.

This provides you with the greatest flexibility, but it does mean that you need to keep your application code in sync with your Cassandra schema.</li>\n<li>You can dynamically marshal an entire query result into an <code>[]map[string]interface{}</code> using the <code>SliceMap()</code> API. This returns a slice of row maps keyed by CQL column names. This method requires no special interaction with the gocql API, but it does require your application to be able to deal with a key value view of your data.</li>\n<li>As a refinement on the <code>SliceMap()</code> API you can also call <code>MapScan()</code> which returns <code>map[string]interface{}</code> instances in a row by row fashion.</li>\n<li>The <code>Bind()</code> API provides a client app with a low level mechanism to introspect query meta data and extract appropriate field values from application level data structures.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://github.com/scylladb/gocqlx\">gocqlx</a> package is an idiomatic extension to gocql that provides usability features. With gocqlx you can bind the query parameters from maps and structs, use named query parameters (:identifier) and scan the query results into structs and slices.

If done in a rolling fashion from PasswordAuthenticator (or some other implementation) connections to an LDAP configured node using non-ldap credentials will fail if usernames and passwords don't match, that is, nodes running LDAPAuthenticator will not be able to access Cassandra users that are <em>not</em> in LDAP. Safest method would be to either support both mechanisms in your application (handle failure with C* users) or switch to AllowAllAuthenticator (in a rolling fashion) prior to switching to LDAPAuthenticator.</p><p>LDAPAuthenticator currently supports plain text authorisation requests only in the form of a username and password. This request is made to the LDAP server over plain text, so you should be using client encryption on the Cassandra side and secure ldap (ldaps) on the LDAP side.</p><p>Credentials are sent from your client to the Cassandra server and then tested against the LDAP server for authentication using a specified service account. This service account should be configured in the <code>ldap.properties</code> file using the <code>service_dn</code> and <code>service_password</code> properties. This can be excluded if you allow anonymous access to ldap (not recommended unless you know what you're doing!).</p><p>On successful authentication to LDAP a corresponding Cassandra user will be created (including for the service user who will be SUPERUSER). These users are never removed, as it is deemed cleanup is not necessary as long as auth is still handled by LDAP. Manual cleanup of users will work fine, and if they re-auth a replacement user will be created. Passwords are not stored in Cassandra, however on 3.11 and later will live in the credentials cache when used.</p><ul><li>See blog by Kurt Greaves <a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/apache-cassandra-ldap-authentication/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Apache Cassandra LDAP Authentication\"</a></li>\n</ul>",

        "content": "<p>This is the Instaclustr public docker image for Apache Cassandra.\nIt contains docker images for Cassandra 3.0 and 3.11.1.</p><p>It contains some of our best practices and lessons learnt from running Cassandra on docker for the last 4 years over 1000's of clusters.\nIt also supports configuration via environment variables in the same manner as the <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/_/cassandra/\" rel=\"nofollow\">official docker cassandra image</a></p><p>Primary configuration of Cassandra should be done by creating a volume mount on the Cassandra config\ndirectory and providing configuration externally (manually, docker swarm, k8s), however support for\nbasic configuration via environment variables does exist. See below.</p><p>Current status: <strong>Beta</strong></p><h2>Start a <code>cassandra</code> server instance</h2><p>Prebuilt images can be fetched by running:</p><div class=\"highlight highlight-text-shell-session\"><pre>docker pull instaclustr/cassandra</pre></div><p>Starting a Cassandra instance is simple:</p><div class=\"highlight highlight-text-shell-session\"><pre>$ docker run --name some-cassandra -d cassandra:tag</pre></div><p>... where <code>some-cassandra</code> is the name you want to assign to your container and <code>tag</code> is the tag specifying the Cassandra version you want. See the list above for relevant tags.</p><h2>Where to Store Data</h2><p>Important note: There are several ways to store data used by applications that run in Docker containers. We encourage users of the <code>cassandra</code> images to familiarize themselves with the options available, including:</p><ul><li>Let Docker manage the storage of your database data <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/#adding-a-data-volume\" rel=\"nofollow\">by writing the database files to disk on the host system using its own internal volume management</a>. This is the default and is easy and fairly transparent to the user. The downside is that the files may be hard to locate for tools and applications that run directly on the host system, i.e. outside containers. Performance will also suffer, this is generally recommended for non production environments.</li>\n<li>Create a data directory on the host system (outside the container) and <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/#mount-a-host-directory-as-a-data-volume\" rel=\"nofollow\">mount this to a directory visible from inside the container</a>. This places the database files in a known location on the host system, and makes it easy for tools and applications on the host system to access the files. The downside is that the user needs to make sure that the directory exists, and that e.g. directory permissions and other security mechanisms on the host system are set up correctly.</li>\n</ul><p>The Docker documentation is a good starting point for understanding the different storage options and variations, and there are multiple blogs and forum postings that discuss and give advice in this area. We will simply show the basic procedure here for the latter option above:</p><ol><li>\n<p>Create a data directory on a suitable volume on your host system, e.g. <code>/my/own/datadir</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Start your <code>cassandra</code> container like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-text-shell-session\"><pre>$ docker run --name some-cassandra -v /my/own/datadir:/var/lib/cassandra -d cassandra:tag</pre></div>\n</li>\n</ol><p>The <code>-v /my/own/datadir:/var/lib/cassandra</code> part of the command mounts the <code>/my/own/datadir</code> directory from the underlying host system as <code>/var/lib/cassandra</code> inside the container, where Cassandra by default will write its data files.</p><p>Note that users on host systems with SELinux enabled may see issues with this. The current workaround is to assign the relevant SELinux policy type to the new data directory so that the container will be allowed to access it:</p><div class=\"highlight highlight-text-shell-session\"><pre>$ chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t /my/own/datadir</pre></div><p>The Cassandra configuration directory (/etc/cassandra) can be managed by docker as a docker volume as appropriate for you environment if you are not using environment variable based configuration.\nThe Cassandra data directory however should generally be a bind mount to a directory on the host with an appropriately configured file system\n(e.g. XFS with a readahead value of 8).</p><p>This docker file does not yet support block device passthrough via the device flag.</p><h2>Configuring the kernel</h2><p>To optimally run Cassandra, the kernal and a few other parameters for the process need to be tuned. Most of these can be done via the docker command being run:</p><div class=\"highlight highlight-text-shell-session\"><pre>--cap-add=IPC_LOCK --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit nofile=100000 --ulimit nproc=32768</pre></div><p>Some sysctl suggestions will need to be set at the docker host level as docker is limited in what tuneables it can modify.\nE.g. changes to the sysctl <code>vm.max_map_count</code></p><p>When utilisting this image with Kubernetes, you can create a privileged init container that will set up the correct sysctl properties\nfor the kubernetes node. Allowing the Cassandra to be run as a non privileged container whilst still being configured correctly.\nFor example:</p><h2>Injecting configuration</h2><p>To provide your own configuration for Cassandra, via a user provided cassandra.yaml, cassandra-env.sh, jvm.properties, rack-dc.properties file etc.\nYou can volume mount the configration directory or use some other configuration management capability (e.g. kubernetes configMaps)</p><div class=\"highlight highlight-text-shell-session\"><pre>$ docker run --name some-cassandra -v /my/own/configdir:/etc/cassandra -d cassandra:tag</pre></div><p>Configuring Cassandra in this manner is not compatible with legacy configuration via <code>CASSANDRA_ENV_OVERRIDES</code>.</p><h2>Legacy configuration</h2><p>This docker images supports configuration via environment variables as well similar to the docker-library image see <a href=\"https://github.com/instaclustr/cassandra-docker/blob/master/LEGACY.md\">legacy documentation</a></p><h2>Elassandra</h2><p>Instaclustr cassandra docker images currently support Elassandra via <a href=\"https://github.com/zegelin/cassandra-docker\">https://github.com/zegelin/cassandra-docker</a>. Elassandra images can be pulled from docker hub via <code>docker pull instaclustr/cassandra:elassandra-5.5.0.13</code>\nExamples can be found in the example directory. Elassandra does not support environment variable configuration.</p>",

It uses bytecode instrumentation to augment Cassandra node with additional functionalities. The following images depicts the position of Cassandra Diagnostics in a Apache Cassandra based system.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/diagrams/cassandra-diagnostics.png?raw=true\"><img src=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/raw/dev/diagrams/cassandra-diagnostics.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Placement diagram\" /></a></p>\n<p>Cassandra Diagnostics has a modular architecture. On one side it has connectors for different versions of Apache Cassandra nodes or Cassandra Java Driver and on the other it has various reporters to send measurement to different collecting/monitoring tools. In between lies the core with a set of metrics processing modules. Reusable code goes to commons.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/diagrams/architecture-diagram.png?raw=true\"><img src=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/raw/dev/diagrams/architecture-diagram.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Architecture diagram\" /></a></p>\n<h3><a id=\"user-content-cassandra-diagnostic-commons\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#cassandra-diagnostic-commons\"></a>Cassandra Diagnostic Commons</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/cassandra-diagnostics-commons\">Cassandra Diagnostics Commons</a> holds interface for core, connector and reports and it provides signature all the modules need to confront to be able to work together.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"user-content-cassandra-connector\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#cassandra-connector\"></a>Cassandra Connector</h3>\n<p>Connector is a module which hooks into the query path and extract information for diagnostics. Bytecode instrumentation is used to augment existing Cassandra code with additional functionality. It uses low priority threads to execute the diagnostics information extraction with minimal performance impact to the target code (Cassandra node or application/driver).</p>\n<p>Currently Cassandra Diagnostics implements the following connector implementation:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/cassandra-diagnostics-connector21\">Cassandra Connector 2.1</a> is a connector implementation for Cassandra node for Cassandra version 2.1.x.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/cassandra-diagnostics-connector30\">Cassandra Connector 3.0</a> is a connector implementation for Cassandra node for Cassandra version 3.0.x.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/cassandra-diagnostics-driver-connector\">Cassandra Driver Connector</a> is a connector implementation for Datastax's Cassandra driver for diagnostics on the application side.</p>\n</li>\n</ul><h3><a id=\"user-content-cassandra-core\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#cassandra-core\"></a>Cassandra Core</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/cassandra-diagnostics-core\">Cassandra Diagnostics Core</a> is glue between connector and reporters. It holds all the modules for diagnostics, it has business logic for measurement and it decides what will be measured and what would be skipped. Its job is to load provided configuration or to setup sensible defaults.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"user-content-modules\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#modules\"></a>Modules</h3>\n<p>There are default module implementations which serve as core features. Modules use configured reporters to report their activity.</p>\n<p>Please read <a href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/cassandra-diagnostics-core/COREMODULES.md\">core modules README</a> for more information and configuraion options for the modules.Core module implementations:</p>\n<h4><a id=\"user-content-heartbeat-module\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#heartbeat-module\"></a>Heartbeat Module</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/cassandra-diagnostics-core/COREMODULES.md#heartbeat-module\">Heartbeat Module</a> produces messages to provide feedback that the diagnostics agent is loaded and working. Typical usage is with Log Reporter where it produces INFO message in configured intervals.\nDefault reporting interval is 15 minutes.</p>\n<h4><a id=\"user-content-slow-query-module\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#slow-query-module\"></a>Slow Query Module</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/cassandra-diagnostics-core/COREMODULES.md#slow-query-module\">Slow Query Module</a> is monitoring execution time of each query and if it is above configured threshold it reports the value and query type using configured reporters.\nDefault query execution time threshold is 25 milliseconds.</p>\n<h4><a id=\"user-content-request-rate-module\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#request-rate-module\"></a>Request Rate Module</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/cassandra-diagnostics-core/COREMODULES.md#request-rate-module\">Request Rate Module</a> uses codahale metrics library to create rate measurement of executed queries. Rates are reported for configurable statement types and consistency levels using configured reporters in configured periods.\nDefault reporting interval is 1 second.</p>\n<h4><a id=\"user-content-metrics-module\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#metrics-module\"></a>Metrics Module</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/cassandra-diagnostics-core/COREMODULES.md#metrics-module\">Metrics Module</a> collects Cassandra's metrics, which are exposed over JMX, and ships them using predefined reporters. Metrics package names configuration is the same as a default metrics config reporter uses.\nDefault reporting interval is 1 second.</p>\n<h4><a id=\"user-content-status-module\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#status-module\"></a>Status Module</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/cassandra-diagnostics-core/COREMODULES.md#status-module\">Status Module</a> is used to report Cassandra information exposed over JMX. It reports compaction information as a single measurement.\nDefault reporting interval is 1 minute.</p>\n<h4><a id=\"user-content-cluster-health-module\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#cluster-health-module\"></a>Cluster Health Module</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/cassandra-diagnostics-core/COREMODULES.md#cluster-health-module\">Cluster Health Module</a> is used to report the health status of the nodes such as which nodes are marked as DOWN by gossiper. It uses the information exposed over JMX.\nDefault reporting interval is 10 seconds.</p>\n<h4><a id=\"user-content-hiccup-module\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#hiccup-module\"></a>Hiccup Module</h4>\n<p>Module based on <a href=\"https://github.com/giltene/jHiccup\">jHiccup</a> that logs and reports platform hiccups including JVM stalls. Default reporting period is 5 seconds and reporter values and percentiles from 90 to 100 and Mean and Max values.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"user-content-reporters\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#reporters\"></a>Reporters</h3>\n<p>Reporters take measurement from core and wrap them up in implementation specific format so it can be sent to reporters target (i.e. Influx reporter transforms measurement to influx query and stores it to InfluxDB).</p>\n<p>Reporter implementations:</p>\n<h4><a id=\"user-content-log-reporter\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#log-reporter\"></a>Log Reporter</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/cassandra-diagnostics-core/src/main/java/io/smartcat/cassandra/diagnostics/reporter/LogReporter.java\">LogReporter</a> uses the Cassandra logger system to report measurement (this is default reporter and part of core). Reports are logged at the <code>INFO</code> log level in the following pattern:</p>\n<pre>Measurement {} [time={}, value={}, tags={}, fields={}]\n</pre>\n<p>Values for <code>time</code> is given in milliseconds. <code>tags</code> are used to better specify measurement and provide additional searchable labels and fields is a placeholder for additional fields connected to this measurement. Example can be Slow Query measurement, where <code>value</code> is execution time of query, <code>tags</code> can be type of statement (UPDATE or SELECT) so you can differentiate and search easy and <code>fields</code> can hold actual statement, which is not something you want to search against but it is valuable metadata for measurement.</p>\n<h4><a id=\"user-content-riemann-reporter\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#riemann-reporter\"></a>Riemann Reporter</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/cassandra-diagnostics-reporter-riemann/README.md\">RiemannReporter</a> sends measurements towards <a href=\"http://riemann.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Riemann server</a>.</p>\n<h4><a id=\"user-content-influx-reporter\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#influx-reporter\"></a>Influx Reporter</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/cassandra-diagnostics-reporter-influx/README.md\">InfluxReporter</a> sends measurements towards <a href=\"https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Influx database</a>.</p>\n<h4><a id=\"user-content-telegraf-reporter\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#telegraf-reporter\"></a>Telegraf Reporter</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/cassandra-diagnostics-reporter-telegraf/README.md\">Telegraf Reporter</a> sends measurements towards <a href=\"https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf\">Telegraf agent</a>.</p>\n<h4><a id=\"user-content-datadog-reporter\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#datadog-reporter\"></a>Datadog Reporter</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/cassandra-diagnostics-reporter-datadog/README.md\">Datadog Reporter</a> sends measurements towards <a href=\"https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent\">Datadog Agent</a> using UDP.</p>\n<h4><a id=\"user-content-kafka-reporter\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#kafka-reporter\"></a>Kafka Reporter</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/cassandra-diagnostics-reporter-kafka/README.md\">Kafka Reporter</a> sends measurements towards <a href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kafka</a>.</p>\n<h4><a id=\"user-content-prometheus-reporter\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#prometheus-reporter\"></a>Prometheus Reporter</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/cassandra-diagnostics-reporter-prometheus/README.md\">Prometheus Reporter</a> exposes measurements to be scraped by <a href=\"https://prometheus.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prometheus server</a>.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"user-content-configuration\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#configuration\"></a>Configuration</h2>\n<p>Cassandra Diagnostics uses an external configuration file in YAML format. You can see default configuration in <a href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/cassandra-diagnostics-core/src/main/resources/cassandra-diagnostics-default.yml\">cassandra-diagnostics-default.yml</a>. The default name of the config file is <code>cassandra-diagnostics.yml</code> and it is expected to be found on the classpath. This can be changed using property <code>cassandra.diagnostics.config</code>.\nFor example, the configuration can be set explicitly by changing <code>cassandra-env.sh</code> and adding the following line:</p>\n<pre>JVM_OPTS=\"$JVM_OPTS -Dcassandra.diagnostics.config=some-other-cassandra-diagnostics-configuration.yml\"\n</pre>\n<p>The following is an example of the configuration file:</p>\n<pre>global:\n  systemName: \"smartcat-cassandra-cluster\"\nreporters:\n  - reporter: io.smartcat.cassandra.diagnostics.reporter.LogReporter\nmodules:\n  - module: io.smartcat.cassandra.diagnostics.module.slowquery.SlowQueryModule\n    measurement: queryReport\n    options:\n      slowQueryThresholdInMilliseconds: 1\n    reporters:\n      - io.smartcat.cassandra.diagnostics.reporter.LogReporter\n</pre>\n<p>Specific query reporter may require additional configuration options. Those options are specified using <code>options</code> property. The following example shows a configuration options in case of <code>RiemannReporter</code> and it shows how you can configure specific modules to use this reporter:</p>\n<pre>global:\n  systemName: \"smartcat-cassandra-cluster\"\n# Reporters\nreporters:\n  - reporter: io.smartcat.cassandra.diagnostics.reporter.LogReporter\n  - reporter: io.smartcat.cassandra.diagnostics.reporter.RiemannReporter\n    options:\n      riemannHost: 127.0.0.1\n      riemannPort: 5555 #Optional\n      batchEventSize: 50 #Optional\n# Modules\nmodules:\n  - module: io.smartcat.cassandra.diagnostics.module.requestrate.RequestRateModule\n    measurement: requestRate\n    options:\n      period: 1\n      timeunit: SECONDS\n    reporters:\n      - io.smartcat.cassandra.diagnostics.reporter.LogReporter\n      - io.smartcat.cassandra.diagnostics.reporter.RiemannReporter\n</pre>\n<p>By default all measurements are reported with hostname queried with <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/InetAddress.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">InetAddress</a> java class. If required, hostname can be set using a hostname variable in configuration file:</p>\n<pre>global:\n  systemName: \"smartcat-cassandra-cluster\"\n  hostname: \"test-hostname\"\nreporters:\netc...\n</pre>\n<p>It is important to name system under observation because measurements can be collected by various systems. Hostname is not enough, it is easy to imagine one host having Cassandra node and Kafka node both emitting measurement and we want to group those by system. By default \"cassandra-cluster\" will be used but it is advised to override this to have unique grouping of measurements:</p>\n<pre>global:\n  systemName: \"cassandra-cluster\"\n  hostname: \"test-hostname\"\n</pre>\n<h2><a id=\"user-content-information-provider\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#information-provider\"></a>Information provider</h2>\n<p>Being deployed on the node itself, diagnostics connector should provide a connection to the node over JMX by wrapping the Cassandra's NodeProbe class with provides access to all actions and metrics exposed over JMX. This is configured in the <code>connector</code> part of the configuration which sits in the root of diagnostics config.</p>\n<pre>connector:\n  jmxHost: 127.0.0.1\n  jmxPort: 7199\n  jmxAuthEnabled: false #Optional\n  jmxUsername: username #Optional\n  jmxPassword: password #Optional\n</pre>\n<p>Status module uses information provided by connector in order to collect info data.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"user-content-control-and-configuration-api\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#control-and-configuration-api\"></a>Control and Configuration API</h2>\n<p>Cassandra Diagnostics exposes a control and configuration API. This API currently offers the following operations:</p>\n<pre>- getVersion - returns the actual Cassandra Diagnostics version.\n- reload - reloads the configuration\n</pre>\n<p>This API is exposed over JMX and HTTP protocols.</p>\n<p>The Diagnostics API JMX MXBean could be found under the following object name:</p>\n<pre>package io.smartcat.cassandra.diagnostics.api:type=DiagnosticsApi\n</pre>\n<p>The HTTP API is controlled using the following options in the <code>global</code> section in the configuration file:</p>\n<pre>global:\n  # controls if HTTP API is turned on. 'true' by default.\n  httpApiEnabled: true\n  # specifies the host/address part for listening TCP socket. '127.0.0.1' by default.\n  httpApiHost: 127.0.0.1\n  # specifies the port number for the listening TCP socket. '8998' by default.\n  httpApiPort: 8998\n  # if API authorization is enabled, API key must be provided through the 'Authorization' header\n  httpApiAuthEnabled: false\n  # API access key\n  httpApiKey: \"diagnostics-api-key\"\n</pre>\n<p>It implements the following endpoints for mapping HTTP requests to API operations:</p>\n<ul><li><code>GET /version</code> for <code>getVersion</code></li>\n<li><code>POST /reload</code> for <code>reload</code></li>\n</ul><h2><a id=\"user-content-installation\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#installation\"></a>Installation</h2>\n<p>Script for automated installation is <a href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/bash-installer/README.md\">also available</a>.</p>\n<p>Cassandra Diagnostics consists of the following three components:</p>\n<ul><li>Cassandra Diagnostics Core</li>\n<li>Cassandra Diagnostics Connector</li>\n<li>Cassandra Diagnostics Reporter</li>\n</ul><p>Every of these components is packaged into its own JAR file (accompanied with necessary dependencies). These JAR files are available for download on <a href=\"https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.smartcat\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maven Central</a> and need to be present on the classpath.</p>\n<p>Pay attention to the fact that Cassandra Diagnostics Connector has to be aligned with the used Cassandra version. For example, <code>cassandra-diagnostics-connector21</code> should be used with Cassandra 2.1.</p>\n<p>Also note that more than one Cassandra Diagnostics Reporter can be used at the same time. That means that all respective JAR files have to be put on the classpath. The only exception to this rule is in case of <code>LogReporter</code> that is built in Cassandra Diagnostics Core and no Reporter JAR has to be added explicitly.</p>\n<p>Place <code>cassandra-diagnostics-core-VERSION.jar</code>, <code>cassandra-diagnostics-connector21-VERSION.jar</code> and required Reporter JARs (e.g. <code>cassandra-diagnostics-reporter-influx-VERSION-all.jar</code>) into Cassandra <code>lib</code> directory.</p>\n<p>Create and place the configuration file <code>cassandra-diagnostics.yml</code> into Cassandra's <code>conf</code> directory.\nAdd the following line at the end of <code>conf/cassandra-env.sh</code>:</p>\n<pre>JVM_OPTS=\"$JVM_OPTS -javaagent:$CASSANDRA_HOME/lib/cassandra-diagnostics-core-VERSION.jar -Dcassandra.diagnostics.config=cassandra-diagnostics.yml\"\n</pre>\n<h2><a id=\"user-content-usage\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#usage\"></a>Usage</h2>\n<p>Upon Cassandra node start, the Diagnostics agent kicks in and instrument necessary target classes to inject diagnostics additions.\n<code>LogReporter</code> repors slow queries in <code>logs/system.log</code> at <code>INFO</code> level.\nThe dynamic configuration could be inspected/changed using <code>jconsole</code> and connecting to <code>org.apache.cassandra.service.CassandraDaemon</code>.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"user-content-build-and-deploy\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#build-and-deploy\"></a>Build and deploy</h2>\n<p>Build and deploy process is described <a href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-diagnostics/blob/dev/BUILDANDDEPLOY.md\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"user-content-license-and-development\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#license-and-development\"></a>License and development</h2>\n<p>Cassandra Diagnostics is licensed under the liberal and business-friendly <a href=\"http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apache Licence, Version 2.0</a> and is freely available on GitHub.

What is new is the ability to collect and analyze massive volumes of data in sequence at extremely high velocity to get the clearest picture to predict and forecast future market changes, user behavior, environmental conditions, resource consumption, health trends and much, much more.</p>\n<p>Apache Cassandra is a NoSQL database platform particularly suited for these types of Big Data challenges. Cassandra’s data model is an excellent fit for handling data in sequence regardless of data type or size. When writing data to Cassandra, data is sorted and written sequentially to disk. When retrieving data by row key and then by range, you get a fast and efficient access pattern due to minimal disk seeks – time series data is an excellent fit for this type of pattern. Apache Cassandra allows businesses to identify meaningful characteristics in their time series data as fast as possible to make clear decisions about expected future outcomes.</p>\n<p>There are many flavors of time series data. Some can be windowed in the stream, others can not be windowed in the stream because queries are not by time slice but by specific year,month,day,hour.

Since it took a life of its own, this is an abridged chronology on how it came about. I’m surely missing something, since it’s a view from (by) the Bay — please comment with any corrections or suggestions, as well as updates. I’m not elaborating the technical merits of the SMACK Stack here, as they are covered at <a href=\"http://noetl.org\" data-href=\"http://noetl.org\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NoETL.org</a>.</p><p id=\"3242\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I’ve first seen the phrase SMACK Stack in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jamie_allen/status/614045214018158592\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/jamie_allen/status/614045214018158592\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tweet by Jamie Allen</a>, attributed to Oliver White, on June 25, 2015. Jamie is a veteran Typesafe/Lightbend executive and Scala/Akka/Reactive practitioner, and Oliver is their Chief Storyteller. By that time, our long-established plan to run <a href=\"http://2015.bigdatascala.bythebay.io/pipeline.html\" data-href=\"http://2015.bigdatascala.bythebay.io/pipeline.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the first end-to-end data pipeline training</a> at Scala By the Bay and Big Data Scala 2015 was in full smack. We brought together the actual five companies comprising the SMACK Stack with their own trainers, training materials, and top OSS contributors, having worked relentlessly to create the actual SMACK Stack training, defining the SMACK Stack by doing and teaching.</p><p id=\"5350\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The original <a href=\"https://chiefscientist.org/sfscala.org\" data-href=\"sfscala.org\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">SF Scala</a> announcement went out on December 23, 2014.

Here it is in the context of collecting questions for the closing panel at Big Data Scala with Martin Odersky, creator of Scala and cofounder of Typesafe (now Lightbend), who keynoted it.</p><figure id=\"0a91\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*THEpX1HaETt6rw6w80-7Fg.png\" data-width=\"2632\" data-height=\"1678\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*THEpX1HaETt6rw6w80-7Fg.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*THEpX1HaETt6rw6w80-7Fg.png\" alt=\"image\" /></div></figure><p id=\"4f8a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The C for Cassandra was added when we invited Ryan Knight and Evan Chan. Ryan transitioned from Typesafe to DataStax, and Evan combined Spark and Cassandra for fast OLAP.</p><p id=\"739c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here’s the final lineup as delivered on the Complete Pipeline Training day</p><p id=\"4b42\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">— <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">S: Scala and Spark</strong> =&gt; Typesafe, Databricks; every trainer was a fairly well-known Scala developer. Chris Fregly represented Databricks and Advanced Spark. Nilanjan Raychaudhuri helped with the Akka presentation. For Spark, we used <a href=\"http://spark-notebook.io\" data-href=\"http://spark-notebook.io\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Spark Notebook</a> as the GUI, presented by its creator Andy Petrella.</p><p id=\"6e57\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">— <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">M: Mesos</strong> =&gt; Mesosphere. Jason Swartz</p><p id=\"3fe6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">— <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">A: Akka</strong> =&gt; Typesafe, Duncan De Vore, Nilanjan with slides, Ryan Knight emeritus.</p><p id=\"91a9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">— <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">C: Cassandra</strong>: Ryan Knight, for a while of Typesafe and then of DataStax, helped across the stack. Evan Chan (of Spark Job Server and FiloDB fame) is recognized for marrying Spark and Cassandra and was also instrumental.</p><p id=\"f58b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">— <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">K: Kafka</strong> =&gt; Confluent. Jesse Anderson was fielded by Confluent as its official training provider. Ewen Cheslak-Postava helped with the Kafka segment in the docker.</p><p id=\"0fbb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here’s the github repo used in the training: <a href=\"https://github.com/bythebay/pipeline\" data-href=\"https://github.com/bythebay/pipeline\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/bythebay/pipeline</a>.</p><p id=\"3576\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It’s important to note that Helena Edelson wrote <a href=\"https://github.com/killrweather/killrweather\" data-href=\"https://github.com/killrweather/killrweather\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">killrweather</a>, a project implementing the SMACK Stack, earlier, and presented it at <a href=\"http://pnwscala.org/2014/index.html\" data-href=\"http://pnwscala.org/2014/index.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">PNWScala</a> 2014 (among other venues). When Ryan and Evan joined the training we considered using killrweather and would have loved to have Helena join us (but she deferred to Ryan). We ended up with a different codebase to simplify setup and allow for Spark Notebook as a Spark GUI. Helena is a pioneer — and now a lead innovator — of SMACK Stack.</p><p id=\"7ada\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Originally, we worked with Mesosphere to spin up a training cluster for every student. (Mesosphere was able to secure GCE credits, but it was not ready to run on GCE.) At that point, Mesosphere messaging was mostly on fully utilizing the datacenter. Immediately after Big Data Scala, <a href=\"https://mesosphere.com/blog/2015/08/20/mesosphere-infinity-youre-4-words-away-from-a-complete-big-data-system/\" data-href=\"https://mesosphere.com/blog/2015/08/20/mesosphere-infinity-youre-4-words-away-from-a-complete-big-data-system/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mesosphere announced <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">dcos infinity</strong></a>, inspired by <a href=\"https://mesosphere.com/blog/2015/07/24/learn-everything-you-need-to-know-about-scala-and-big-data-in-oakland/\" data-href=\"https://mesosphere.com/blog/2015/07/24/learn-everything-you-need-to-know-about-scala-and-big-data-in-oakland/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the SMACK training By the Bay</a>. Infinity spins up Kafka, Spark and Cassandra working together. The SMACK Stack training By the Bay was the catalyst that lead to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">dcos infinity</em> — I pitched it to Flo directly (my good friend Jason Swartz was a devmanager at Mesosphere and we discussed it over lunch on the deck), and Flo put us together with Matt Trifiro, the CMO, with whom we continue to collaborate. It is important to observe that the data pipeline offering encapsulated by <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">dcos infinity</em> heralded a new direction for Mesosphere, from data center utilization to data pipeline integration as a product. They’ve not called it “<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">dcos smack”</em> to allow for database vendor neutrality. (We’ve also discussed “<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">dcos khrabrov</em>” as an easily googlable alias.:)</p><p id=\"62ce\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The training was an incredible success — we had a 100 people at Galvanize going over the whole stack in one day, using a fully dockerized setup we provided on USB. It took five sweaty guys in an AirBnB — that Andy Petrella rented — to finalize the night before, after which I took it home to replicate on a device running under Windows. Of course it failed, and I manually copied the USBs into the night. But thanks to Nitro docker genius Ben Rizkowski, it worked great. Ben even popped in a Slack support channel, on a Sunday, while house-hunting in the East Bay.</p><p id=\"f0ba\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a href=\"http://2015.bigdatascala.bythebay.io\" data-href=\"http://2015.bigdatascala.bythebay.io\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Big Data Scala</a> was held for the first time together with the training. It was keynoted by Martin Odersky, the creator of Scala, Matei Zaharia, the creator of Spark, Jay Kreps, the creator of Kafka, and Mike Olson, the CSO of Cloudera. Here we had most of the creators of the SMACK stack in person, as well as its key proponents and integrators. We’ve unveiled <a href=\"http://noetl.org\" data-href=\"http://noetl.org\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NoETL.org</a> there as a way to popularize the reactive, streaming approach to data, as opposed to batching and dumping/reparsing text from HDFS. NoETL is in fact another way to describe what SMACK is good for, as a new way to write data pipelines.</p><p id=\"b487\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Since all of original SMACK Stack trainers are public speakers and OSS leads, the notion spread fast. Notably, Evan Chan moved forward with <a href=\"https://github.com/tuplejump/FiloDB\" data-href=\"https://github.com/tuplejump/FiloDB\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FiloDB</a>, combining Cassandra and Spark to support OLAP. Evan presented his work at SF Scala and SF Spark, as well as Scala By the Bay and Big Data Scala, and subsequently teamed up with Helena Edelson to advance FiloDB and SMACK Stack in industry. Evan ran a Q&amp;A with O’Reilly in the Fall 2015. At the same time we took SMACK Stack to Europe via the Nitro office, the home of the Dublin Spark meetup. We also regularly host Andy Petrella at there regularly who further spread the word. Dean Wampler, the Lightbend Big Data architect, will present SMACK Stack at the O’Reilly Architecture conference this Fall (2016) — see how <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deanwampler/status/752510307562586112\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/deanwampler/status/752510307562586112\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the SMACKing already began</a>!</p><p id=\"b52d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The SMACK Stack concept had become such a hit that I and other Nitro practitioners were approached by publishers to put together a book describing it. I’m helping drive such a project, and we’re looking for co-authors — ping me if you’re interested.</p><p id=\"747f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It’s a good time to remind all SMACK lovers that Scala By the Bay and Big Data Scala are held at Twitter this year, employing its own SMACK Stack that you can see every day in action — e.g. when you like a tweet and someone gets a notification immediately, for millions of tweets. We’re calling the whole conference Scale+Scala By the Bay, or simply <a href=\"http://scala.bythebay.io\" data-href=\"http://scala.bythebay.io\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Scalæ By the Bay</a>, and run three tracks over three days, all joined in harmony. The tracks are as follows:</p><p id=\"518f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">— Thoughtful Sofware Engineering with Types</p><p id=\"2ce3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">— Reactive Systems and Streaming</p><p id=\"39b3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">— Data Pipelines for Data Engineering and Machine Learning. This is SMACK Stack in action.</p><p id=\"0f17\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">SMACK is a registered trademark of By the Bay, LLC (pending). It was first used in our SMACK training commercially, and nowhere else before it. We trained a hundred people to build a whole big data backend in a day, and they took this knowledge to the world. It’s important this history, however brief, is acknowledged when using the term SMACK stack.</p>",

It contains\ninterfaces, value objects, and the basic set of dependencies necessary to glue\ndifferent components together.</p><p>Submodules include <a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/heroic/blob/master/metric\"><code>metric</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/heroic/blob/master/suggest\"><code>suggest</code></a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/heroic/blob/master/metadata\"><code>metadata</code></a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/heroic/blob/master/aggregation\"><code>aggregation</code></a>. The first three\ncontain various implementations of the given backend type, while the latter\nprovides aggregation methods.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/heroic/blob/master/heroic-core\"><code>heroic-core</code></a> contains the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/heroic/blob/master/heroic-core/src/main/java/com/spotify/heroic/HeroicCore.java\"><code>com.spotify.heroic.HeroicCore</code></a>\nclass which is the central building block for setting up a Heroic instance.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/heroic/blob/master/heroic-elasticsearch-utils\"><code>heroic-elasticsearch-utils</code></a> is a collection of\nutilities for interacting with Elasticsearch. This is separate since we have\nmore than one backend that needs to talk with elasticsearch.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/heroic/blob/master/heroic-parser\"><code>heroic-parser</code></a> provides an Antlr4 implementation of\n<a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/heroic/blob/master/heroic-component/src/main/java/com/spotify/heroic/grammar/QueryParser.java\"><code>com.spotify.heroic.grammar.QueryParser</code></a>,\nwhich is used to parse the Heroic DSL.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/heroic/blob/master/heroic-shell\"><code>heroic-shell</code></a> contains\n<a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/heroic/blob/master/heroic-shell/src/main/java/com/spotify/heroic/HeroicShell.java\"><code>com.spotify.heroic.HeroicShell</code></a>,\na shell capable of either running a standalone, or connecting to an existing\nHeroic instance for administration.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/heroic/blob/master/heroic-all\"><code>heroic-all</code></a> contains dependencies and references to all modules\nthat makes up a Heroic distribution. This is also where profiles are defined\nsince they need to have access to all dependencies.</p><p>Anything in the <a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/heroic/blob/master/repackaged\"><code>repackaged</code></a> directory is dependencies that\ninclude one or more Java packages that must be relocated to avoid conflicts.\nThese are exported under the <code>com.spotify.heroic.repackaged</code> groupId.</p><p>Finally there is <a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/heroic/blob/master/heroic-dist\"><code>heroic-dist</code></a>, a small project that depends on\n<a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/heroic/blob/master/heroic-all\"><code>heroic-all</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/heroic/blob/master/heroic-shell\"><code>heroic-shell</code></a>, and a logging\nimplementation. Here is where everything is bound together into a distribution\n— a shaded jar. It also provides the entry-point for services, namely\n<a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/heroic/blob/master/heroic-dist/src/main/java/com/spotify/heroic/HeroicService.java\"><code>com.spotify.heroic.HeroicService</code></a>.</p><h4>Bypassing Validation</h4><p>To bypass automatic formatting and checkstyle validation you can use the\nfollowing stanza:</p><div class=\"highlight highlight-source-java\"><pre>// @formatter:off\nfinal List&lt;String&gt; list = ImmutableList.of(\n   \"Welcome to...\",\n   \"... The Wild West\"\n);\n// @formatter:on</pre></div><p>To bypass a FindBugs error, you should use the <code>@SupressFBWarnings</code> annotation.</p><div class=\"highlight highlight-source-java\"><pre>@SupressFBWarnings(value=\"FINDBUGS_ERROR_CODE\", justification=\"I Know Better Than FindBugs\")\npublic class IKnowBetterThanFindbugs() {\n    // ...\n}</pre></div><h2>HeroicShell</h2><p>Heroic comes with a shell that contains many useful tasks, these can either\nbe run in a readline-based shell with some basic completions and history, or\nstandalone.</p><p>You can use the following helper script to run the shell directly from the\nproject.</p><div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>$ tools/heroic-shell [opts]</pre></div><p>There are a few interesting options available, most notably is <code>--connect</code> that\nallows the shell to connect to a remote heroic instance.</p><p>See <code>-h</code> for a full listing of options.</p><p>You can run individual tasks in <em>standalone</em> mode, giving you a bit more\noptions (like redirecting output) through the following.</p><div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>$ tools/heroic-shell &lt;heroic-options&gt; -- com.spotify.heroic.shell.task.&lt;task-name&gt; &lt;task-options&gt;</pre></div><p>There are also profiles that can be activated with the <code>-P &lt;profile&gt;</code> switch,\navailable profiles are listed in <code>--help</code>.</p><h2>Repackaged Dependencies</h2><p>These are third-party dependencies that has to be repackaged to avoid binary\nincompatibilities with dependencies.</p><p>Every time these are upgraded, they must be inspected for new conflicts.\nThe easiest way to do this, is to build the project and look at the warnings\nfor the shaded jar.</p><pre>$&gt; mvn clean package -D maven.test.skip=true\n...\n[WARNING] foo-3.5.jar, foo-4.5.jar define 10 overlapping classes:\n[WARNING]   - com.foo.ConflictingClass\n...\n</pre><p>This would indicate that there is a package called foo with overlapping\nclasses.</p><p>You can find the culprit using the <code>dependency</code> plugin.</p><pre>$&gt; mvn package dependency:tree\n</pre>",

When working with multiple nodes each exposed IP address must be\nin sequential order. For example, the last number in the 4th octet of\na IPv4 address must start with <code>1</code> (e.g. 192.168.33.11). See\n<a href=\"https://github.com/riptano/ccm/blob/master/misc/Vagrantfile\">Vagrantfile</a> for help with configuration of remote\nCCM machine.</p><h2>Known issues</h2><p>Windows only:</p><ul><li><code>node start</code> pops up a window, stealing focus.</li>\n<li>cqlsh started from ccm show incorrect prompts on command-prompt</li>\n<li>non nodetool-based command-line options fail (sstablesplit, scrub, etc)</li>\n<li>To install psutil, you must use the .msi from pypi. pip install psutil will not work</li>\n<li>You will need ant.bat in your PATH in order to build C* from source</li>\n<li>You must run with an Unrestricted Powershell Execution-Policy if using Cassandra 2.1.0+</li>\n<li>Ant installed via <a href=\"https://chocolatey.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chocolatey</a> will not be found by ccm, so you must create a symbolic\nlink in order to fix the issue (as administrator):\n<ul><li>cmd /c mklink C:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\bin\\ant.bat C:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\bin\\ant.exe</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul><p>Remote Execution only:</p><ul><li>Using <code>--config-dir</code> and <code>--install-dir</code> with <code>create</code> may not work as\nexpected; since the configuration directory and the installation directory\ncontain lots of files they will not be copied over to the remote machine\nlike most other options for cluster and node operations</li>\n<li>cqlsh started from ccm using remote execution will not start\nproperly (e.g.<code>ccm --ssh-host 192.168.33.11 node1 cqlsh</code>); however\n<code>-x &lt;CMDS&gt;</code> or <code>--exec=CMDS</code> can still be used to execute a CQLSH command\non a remote node.</li>\n</ul><h2>Installation</h2><p>ccm uses python distutils so from the source directory run:</p><pre>sudo ./setup.py install\n</pre><p>ccm is available on the <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/ccm/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Python Package Index</a>:</p><pre>pip install ccm\n</pre><p>There is also a <a href=\"https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/ccm.rb\">Homebrew package</a> available:</p><pre>brew install ccm\n</pre><h2>Usage</h2><p>Let's say you wanted to fire up a 3 node Cassandra cluster.</p><h3>Short version</h3><pre>ccm create test -v 2.0.5 -n 3 -s\n</pre><p>You will of course want to replace <code>2.0.5</code> by whichever version of Cassandra\nyou want to test.</p><h3>Longer version</h3><p>ccm works from a Cassandra source tree (not the jars). There are two ways to\ntell ccm how to find the sources:</p><ol><li>\n<p>If you have downloaded <em>and</em> compiled Cassandra sources, you can ask ccm\nto use those by initiating a new cluster with:</p>\n<p>ccm create test --install-dir=&lt;path/to/cassandra-sources&gt;</p>\n<p>or, from that source tree directory, simply</p>\n<pre> ccm create test\n</pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can ask ccm to use a released version of Cassandra. For instance to\nuse Cassandra 2.0.5, run</p>\n<pre> ccm create test -v 2.0.5\n</pre>\n<p>ccm will download the binary (from <a href=\"http://archive.apache.org/dist/cassandra\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://archive.apache.org/dist/cassandra</a>),\nand set the new cluster to use it. This means\nthat this command can take a few minutes the first time you\ncreate a cluster for a given version. ccm saves the compiled\nsource in <code>~/.ccm/repository/</code>, so creating a cluster for that\nversion will be much faster the second time you run it\n(note however that if you create a lot of clusters with\ndifferent versions, this will take up disk space).</p>\n</li>\n</ol><p>Once the cluster is created, you can populate it with 3 nodes with:</p><pre>ccm populate -n 3\n</pre><p>For Mac OSX, create a new interface for every node besides the first, for example if you populated your cluster with 3 nodes, create interfaces for 127.0.0.2 and 127.0.0.3 like so:</p><pre>sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.2\nsudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.3\n</pre><p>Note these aliases will disappear on reboot. For permanent network aliases on Mac OSX see <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/riptano/ccm/blob/master/NETWORK_ALIASES.md\"><img src=\"https://github.com/riptano/ccm/raw/master/NETWORK_ALIASES.md\" alt=\"Network Aliases\" /></a>.</p><p>After that execute:</p><pre>ccm start\n</pre><p>That will start 3 nodes on IP 127.0.0.[1, 2, 3] on port 9160 for thrift, port\n7000 for the internal cluster communication and ports 7100, 7200 and 7300 for JMX.\nYou can check that the cluster is correctly set up with</p><pre>ccm node1 ring\n</pre><p>You can then bootstrap a 4th node with</p><pre>ccm add node4 -i 127.0.0.4 -j 7400 -b\n</pre><p>(populate is just a shortcut for adding multiple nodes initially)</p><p>ccm provides a number of conveniences, like flushing all of the nodes of\nthe cluster:</p><pre>ccm flush\n</pre><p>or only one node:</p><pre>ccm node2 flush\n</pre><p>You can also easily look at the log file of a given node with:</p><pre>ccm node1 showlog\n</pre><p>Finally, you can get rid of the whole cluster (which will stop the node and\nremove all the data) with</p><pre>ccm remove\n</pre><p>The list of other provided commands is available through</p><pre>ccm\n</pre><p>Each command is then documented through the <code>-h</code> (or <code>--help</code>) flag. For\ninstance <code>ccm add -h</code> describes the options for <code>ccm add</code>.</p><h3>Remote Usage (SSH/Paramiko)</h3><p>All the usage examples above will work exactly the same for a remotely\nconfigured machine; however remote options are required in order to establish a\nconnection to the remote machine before executing the CCM commands:</p><table><thead><tr><th align=\"left\">Argument</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Value</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\">--ssh-host</td>\n<td align=\"left\">string</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Hostname or IP address to use for SSH connection</td>\n</tr><tr><td align=\"left\">--ssh-port</td>\n<td align=\"left\">int</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Port to use for SSH connection<br />Default is 22</td>\n</tr><tr><td align=\"left\">--ssh-username</td>\n<td align=\"left\">string</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Username to use for username/password or public key authentication</td>\n</tr><tr><td align=\"left\">--ssh-password</td>\n<td align=\"left\">string</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Password to use for username/password or private key passphrase using public key authentication</td>\n</tr><tr><td align=\"left\">--ssh-private-key</td>\n<td align=\"left\">filename</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Private key to use for SSH connection</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><h4>Special Handling</h4><p>Some commands require files to be located on the remote server. Those commands\nare pre-processed, file transfers are initiated, and updates are made to the\nargument value for the remote execution of the CCM command:</p><table><thead><tr><th align=\"left\">Parameter</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\"><code>--dse-credentials</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Copy local DSE credentials file to remote server</td>\n</tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><code>--node-ssl</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Recursively copy node SSL directory to remote server</td>\n</tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><code>--ssl</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Recursively copy SSL directory to remote server</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><h4>Short Version</h4><pre>ccm --ssh-host=192.168.33.11 --ssh-username=vagrant --ssh-password=vagrant create test -v 2.0.5 -n 3 -i 192.168.33.1 -s\n</pre><p><strong>Note</strong>: <code>-i</code> is used to add an IP prefix during the create process to ensure\nthat the nodes communicate using the proper IP address for their node</p><h3>Source Distribution</h3><p>If you'd like to use a source distribution instead of the default binary each time (for example, for Continuous Integration), you can prefix cassandra version with <code>source:</code>, for example:</p><pre>ccm create test -v source:2.0.5 -n 3 -s\n</pre><h3>Automatic Version Fallback</h3><p>If 'binary:' or 'source:' are not explicitly specified in your version string, then ccm will fallback to building the requested version from git if it cannot access the apache mirrors.</p><h3>Git and GitHub</h3><p>To use the latest version from the <a href=\"https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cassandra.git\" rel=\"nofollow\">canonical Apache Git repository</a>, use the version name <code>git:branch-name</code>, e.g.:</p><pre>ccm create trunk -v git:trunk -n 5\n</pre><p>and to download a branch from a GitHub fork of Cassandra, you can prefix the repository and branch with <code>github:</code>, e.g.:</p><pre>ccm create patched -v github:jbellis/trunk -n 1\n</pre><h3>Bash command-line completion</h3><p>ccm has many sub-commands for both cluster commands as well as node commands, and sometimes you don't quite remember the name of the sub-command you want to invoke. Also, command lines may be long due to long cluster or node names.</p><p>Leverage bash's <em>programmable completion</em> feature to make ccm use more pleasant. Copy <code>misc/ccm-completion.bash</code> to somewhere in your home directory (or /etc if you want to make it accessible to all users of your system) and source it in your <code>.bash_profile</code>:</p><pre>. ~/scripts/ccm-completion.bash\n</pre><p>Once set up, <code>ccm sw&lt;tab&gt;</code> expands to <code>ccm switch</code>, for example. The <code>switch</code> sub-command has extra completion logic to help complete the cluster name. So <code>ccm switch cl&lt;tab&gt;</code> would expand to <code>ccm switch cluster-58</code> if cluster-58 is the only cluster whose name starts with \"cl\". If there is ambiguity, hitting <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> a second time shows the choices that match:</p><pre>$ ccm switch cl&lt;tab&gt;\n    ... becomes ...\n$ ccm switch cluster-\n    ... then hit tab twice ...\ncluster-56  cluster-85  cluster-96\n$ ccm switch cluster-8&lt;tab&gt;\n    ... becomes ...\n$ ccm switch cluster-85\n</pre><p>It dynamically determines available sub-commands based on the ccm being invoked. Thus, users running multiple ccm's (or a ccm that they are continuously updating with new commands) will automagically work.</p><p>The completion script relies on ccm having two hidden subcommands:</p><ul><li>show-cluster-cmds - emits the names of cluster sub-commands.</li>\n<li>show-node-cmds - emits the names of node sub-commands.</li>\n</ul><p>Thus, it will not work with sufficiently old versions of ccm.</p><h2>Remote debugging</h2><p>If you would like to connect to your Cassandra nodes with a remote debugger you have to pass the <code>-d</code> (or <code>--debug</code>) flag to the populate command:</p><pre>ccm populate -d -n 3\n</pre><p>That will populate 3 nodes on IP 127.0.0.[1, 2, 3] setting up the remote debugging on ports 2100, 2200 and 2300.\nThe main thread will not be suspended so you don't have to connect with a remote debugger to start a node.</p><p>Alternatively you can also specify a remote port with the <code>-r</code> (or <code>--remote-debug-port</code>) flag while adding a node</p><pre>ccm add node4 -r 5005 -i 127.0.0.4 -j 7400 -b\n</pre><h2>Where things are stored</h2><p>By default, ccm stores all the node data and configuration files under <code>~/.ccm/cluster_name/</code>.\nThis can be overridden using the <code>--config-dir</code> option with each command.</p><h2>DataStax Enterprise</h2><p>CCM 2.0 supports creating and interacting with DSE clusters. The --dse\noption must be used with the <code>ccm create</code> command. See the <code>ccm create -h</code>\nhelp for assistance.</p><h2>CCM Lib</h2><p>The ccm facilities are available programmatically through ccmlib. This could\nbe used to implement automated tests against Cassandra. A simple example of\nhow to use ccmlib follows:</p><pre>import ccmlib.cluster\nCLUSTER_PATH=\".\"\ncluster = ccmlib.cluster.Cluster(CLUSTER_PATH, 'test', cassandra_version='2.1.14')\ncluster.populate(3).start()\n[node1, node2, node3] = cluster.nodelist()\n# do some tests on the cluster/nodes. To connect to a node through thrift,\n# the host and port to a node is available through\n#   node.network_interfaces['thrift']\ncluster.flush()\nnode2.compact()\n# do some other tests\n# after the test, you can leave the cluster running, you can stop all nodes\n# using cluster.stop() but keep the data around (in CLUSTER_PATH/test), or\n# you can remove everything with cluster.remove()\n</pre><p>--\nSylvain Lebresne <a href=\"mailto:sylvain@datastax.com\">sylvain@datastax.com</a></p>",

Openning <code>http://localhost:3000</code>, or whatever address you've specified in the browser, loads the AngularJS application and it starts interacting with the HTTP API of <code>cassandra-web</code>. This api uses the <a href=\"http://datastax.github.io/ruby-driver/\">Ruby Driver</a> to communicate with an <a href=\"http://cassandra.apache.org/\">Apache Cassandra</a> cluster.</p><p>When the frontend has fully loaded, <a href=\"https://github.com/avalanche123/cassandra-web/blob/master/app/public/js/cassandra.js#L108\">it subscribes to <code>/events</code> API endpoint</a>, and begins receiving <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-eventsource-20120426/\">Server Sent Events</a>. <a href=\"https://github.com/avalanche123/cassandra-web/blob/master/app/helpers/sse.rb#L43-L56\">The API uses an event listener, which is registered with the <code>Cluster</code> instance created by the Ruby Driver, to stream events</a> such as <a href=\"https://github.com/avalanche123/cassandra-web/blob/master/app/helpers/sse.rb#L29-L39\">schema</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/avalanche123/cassandra-web/blob/master/app/helpers/sse.rb#L13-L27\">node status</a> changes to update the user interface without having to refresh the page.</p><p>You can see this feature in action by creating a keyspace using the execute button in the top-right corner of the UI and executing the following statement:</p><pre>CREATE KEYSPACE example WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1}\n</pre><p>If the statement executed successfully, you should see a new keyspace show up on the left side of the UI.</p><p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avalanche123/cassandra-web/master/animation.gif\" alt=\"Alt text\" title=\"Create Keyspace\" /></p><p>The web server, Thin, used by <code>cassandra-web</code> is asynchronous and uses only a single thread to handle requests. This enables efficient handling multiple of long running connections, which is a requirement for streaming and Server Sent Events, but also means that the application cannot perform blocking operations during request handling, since it would hang up all connections for the duration of the blocking operation. <code>cassandra-web</code> therefore uses Asynchronous Execution feature of the Ruby Driver to not block on statements execution. <a href=\"https://github.com/avalanche123/cassandra-web/blob/master/app.rb#L88\">The application executes statements asynchronously, receiving a future from the Ruby Driver</a>. <a href=\"https://github.com/avalanche123/cassandra-web/blob/master/app/helpers/async.rb#L7-L40\">It then registers future completion listeners to send a response (or error) whenever it becomes available</a>.</p><h2>\nCredits</h2><p>Cassandra web is possible because of the following awesome technologies (in no particular order):</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://cassandra.apache.org/\">Apache Cassandra</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://datastax.github.io/ruby-driver/\">DataStax Ruby Driver for Apache Cassandra</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra\">Sinatra</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://angularjs.org/\">AngularJS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\">Twitter Bootstrap</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/\">Thin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-eventsource-20120426/\">Server Sent Events</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://prismjs.com/\">PrismJS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://codemirror.net/\">CodeMirror</a></li>\n<li>and many others...</li>\n</ul>",

        "content": "<p><em>This is the second part of the Cassandra Monitoring miniseries, index of all parts below:</em></p><ol><li><em><a href=\"https://softwaremill.com/cassandra-monitoring-part-1/\">Cassandra Monitoring - part I - Introduction</a></em></li>\n<li><em><a href=\"https://softwaremill.com/cassandra-monitoring-part-2/\">Cassandra Monitoring - part II - Graphite/InfluxDB &amp; Grafana on Docker</a></em></li>\n</ol><p>In this blogpost we will continue exploring the topic of <a href=\"http://cassandra.apache.org/\">Cassandra</a> metric reporters mentioned in <a href=\"https://softwaremill.com/cassandra-monitoring-part-1/\">Part I</a>. Our goal is to configure a reporter that sends metrics to an external time series database. For visualization we will use <a href=\"http://grafana.org/\">Grafana</a>, which can read data directly from various time series databases. We are going to heavily leverage <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/\">Docker</a>, so that we can omit the irrelevant setup details of various projects. To make it easier to set up a full working example, we have prepared a <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/products/docker-compose\">Docker Compose</a> script in our <a href=\"https://github.com/softwaremill/cassandra-monitoring\">GitHub repository</a>.</p><p>As a prerequisite for following this post, please install <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/\">Docker</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/compose/\">Docker Compose</a> on your machine. For instructions please see the linked docs.</p><p>We are going to describe two configuration variants - Cassandra-Graphite-Grafana and Cassandra-InfluxDB-Grafana over the Graphite protocol.</p><h2 id=\"network\">Network</h2><p>Both variants will require 3 containers each. Cassandra and Grafana will need access to the time series store. Links between Docker containers are currently a <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/v1.11/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/dockerlinks/\">legacy</a> feature, so we are going to use <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/v1.11/engine/userguide/networking/dockernetworks/\">Docker networking</a>. We are going to create just one network and attach all containers to it. Each of the containers will be accessible in our network under a hostname identical to their name.</p><p>To create the network you need to run:</p><pre>docker network create monitoring-network\n</pre><p>Note:\nIn our Docker Compose example scripts we do not set up a network explicitly, because it generates one <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/v1.11/compose/networking/\">automatically</a> for the application.</p><p>Let's start with setting up a time series database. We will now describe two mutually exclusive configuration options. Remember that you only need one of them to get the monitoring working.</p><h3 id=\"graphite\">Graphite</h3><p>Unfortunately there is no official <a href=\"https://graphiteapp.org/\">Graphite</a> Docker image, so we have to use one of the non-official ones from <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/sitespeedio/graphite/\">Docker Hub</a>.</p><p>In order to run the selected image, execute:</p><pre>docker run -d  -p 8080:80 -p 2003:2003 --net monitoring-network \\\n    --name graphite sitespeedio/graphite:0.9.14\n</pre><p>This means that we are running the <code>sitespeedio/graphite:0.9.14</code> image, creating a container named <code>graphite</code>, attached to network <code>monitoring-network</code>, mapping the container’s internal ports to local <code>8080</code> and <code>2003</code>. Everything is going to work in the background (<code>-d</code>).</p><p>The <code>http://localhost:8080</code> presents a simple web interface. Port <code>2003</code> is for the API. Default user and password is <code>guest</code> and <code>guest</code>.</p><p>Graphite installation without Docker is a bit complicated, so one of the Graphite developers has created a separate <a href=\"https://github.com/obfuscurity/synthesize\">project</a> purely for making the installation easier.</p><p><img src=\"https://softwaremill.com/images/uploads/2016/07/cassandra-monitoring-2b-graphite.71ca7b7e.png\" alt=\"Graphite Web UI\" /></p><p>Although the UI is a bit outdated, it is still capable of drawing graphs; moreover, Graphite itself also provides a graph rendering API. Graphite is a very <a href=\"http://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html\">powerful</a> tool and it <a href=\"https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.15/functions.html\">implements numerous functions</a> which can be applied to the data.</p><p>Messages sent to Graphite have a very simple format: <code>metric_path value timestamp\\n</code>. This means that a single metric path can have only a single value for a given timestamp.</p><h3 id=\"influxdb\">InfluxDB</h3><p><a href=\"https://influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/\">InfluxDB</a> is a relatively new <a href=\"https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb\">open source</a> time series database written in <a href=\"https://golang.org/\">Go</a>. The 1.0 release is planned for summer 2016. Official InfluxDB Docker images are available on <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb/\">Docker Hub</a>. In this post we are using InfluxDB 0.13.0.</p><p>In our demonstration we are going to report data from Cassandra using the Graphite format, so we need to enable InfluxDB support for receiving data in this format. In order to do that, we have to pass one additional environment variable when creating the container:</p><pre>docker run -d -p 8083:8083 -p 8086:8086 \\\n    -e INFLUXDB_GRAPHITE_ENABLED=true \\\n    --net monitoring-network  \\\n    --name influxdb  \\\n    influxdb:0.13.0\n</pre><p>The <code>http://localhost:8083</code> presents a simple web UI. Port <code>8086</code> is for the API. Default user and password is <code>admin</code> and <code>admin</code>.</p><p><img src=\"https://softwaremill.com/images/uploads/2016/07/cassandra-monitoring-2b-influxdb.38631e4c.png\" alt=\"InfluxDB Web UI\" /></p><p>InfluxDB <a href=\"https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v0.13/concepts/key_concepts/\">data model</a> can be more complex than Graphite. For a given timestamp and measurement name, it is possible to store multiple fields and, additionally, every measurement can be described using multiple tags. Tags are indexed, so it is possible to query measurements efficiently, e.g. for a specific node or environment. However, in this blog post we are configuring InfluxDB to receive data using the Graphite protocol, so it does not leverage all these features. A single measurement for a given timestamp only contains one column named <code>value</code>.</p><p>Querying data stored in InfluxDB is possible via <a href=\"https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v0.13/query_language/data_exploration/\">InfluxQL</a>, which is an SQL-like language.</p><h2 id=\"cassandra\">Cassandra</h2><p>Official Cassandra images exist on <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/_/cassandra/\">Docker Hub</a> - however,  they do not satisfy our needs. There are 3 things which need to be done in order to report metrics from Cassandra to an external system:</p><ol><li>Cassandra distribution is minimalistic and does not include the JAR used for Graphite reporting. For Cassandra &gt;= 2.2 the <a href=\"http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/dropwizard/metrics/metrics-graphite/3.1.0/metrics-graphite-3.1.0.jar\"><code>metrics-graphite-3.1.0.jar</code></a> is required and for &lt;= 2.1 the <a href=\"http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/yammer/metrics/metrics-graphite/2.2.0/metrics-graphite-2.2.0.jar\"><code>metrics-graphite-2.2.0.jar</code></a>.</li>\n<li>Reporting <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/conf/metrics-reporter-config-sample.yaml\">configuration</a> needs to be created.</li>\n<li>Edit <code>cassandra-env.sh</code> in order to add the following line: <code>JVM_OPTS=\"$JVM_OPTS -Dcassandra.metricsReporterConfigFile=&lt;reporting-configuration&gt;.yaml\"</code> with the path to the configuration created in the previous step.</li>\n</ol><p><br />In this example we are going to use Cassandra 3.7.</p><p>Adding required files is pretty simple when you use a standalone Cassandra distribution; however, for Docker we need to create a new image. We will go with a \"minimalistic\" approach and extend the official one. To build the image, you need to create a directory in which we will place a <code>Dockerfile</code>, reporting configuration and the appropriate <code>.jar</code>.</p><h3 id=\"cassandra-graphite-grafana-\">Cassandra-Graphite-Grafana:</h3><p><code>Dockerfile</code>:</p><pre>FROM cassandra:3.7\nCOPY graphite.yaml /etc/cassandra/\nRUN echo \"JVM_OPTS=\\\"\\$JVM_OPTS -Dcassandra.metricsReporterConfigFile=graphite.yaml\\\"\" \\\n    &gt;&gt; /etc/cassandra/cassandra-env.sh\nCOPY metrics-graphite-3.1.0.jar /usr/share/cassandra/lib/\n</pre><p><code>graphite.yaml</code>:</p><pre>graphite:\n-\n  period: 60\n  timeunit: 'SECONDS'\n  prefix: 'Node1'\n  hosts:\n  - host: 'graphite'\n    port: 2003\n  predicate:\n    color: \"white\"\n    useQualifiedName: true\n    patterns:\n    - \".*\"\n</pre><h3 id=\"cassandra-influxdb-grafana-over-graphite-protocol-\">Cassandra-InfluxDB-Grafana over Graphite protocol:</h3><p><code>Dockerfile</code>:</p><pre>FROM cassandra:3.7\nCOPY influxdb.yaml /etc/cassandra/\nRUN echo \"JVM_OPTS=\\\"\\$JVM_OPTS -Dcassandra.metricsReporterConfigFile=influxdb.yaml\\\"\" \\\n    &gt;&gt; /etc/cassandra/cassandra-env.sh\nCOPY metrics-graphite-3.1.0.jar /usr/share/cassandra/lib/\n</pre><p><code>influxdb.yaml</code>:</p><pre>graphite:\n-\n  period: 60\n  timeunit: 'SECONDS'\n  prefix: 'Node1'\n  hosts:\n  - host: 'influxdb'\n    port: 2003\n  predicate:\n    color: \"white\"\n    useQualifiedName: true\n    patterns:\n    - \".*\"\n</pre><h3 id=\"differences\">Differences</h3><p>Both of these setups use the Graphite protocol, so they are almost identical. The only difference is the hostname of the time series database. For Graphite, we reference the <code>graphite</code> container via its hostname and, for InfluxDB, the <code>influxdb</code> hostname. The <code>prefix</code> value will be prepended to every metric name - this way you can make metrics coming from different nodes distinguishable.</p><p>Additionally, in both cases you need to put the <a href=\"http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/dropwizard/metrics/metrics-graphite/3.1.0/metrics-graphite-3.1.0.jar\"><code>metrics-graphite-3.1.0.jar</code></a> in the same directory with the <code>Dockerfile</code> and reporting configuration.</p><p>Both of these Cassandra scenarios are available on GitHub\nfor <a href=\"https://github.com/softwaremill/cassandra-monitoring/tree/master/part-II-cassandra-graphite-grafana/cassandra-graphite\">Graphite</a> and for <a href=\"https://github.com/softwaremill/cassandra-monitoring/tree/master/part-II-cassandra-influx-via-graphite-grafana/cassandra-influx-via-graphite\">InfluxDB over Graphite protocol</a>.</p><h3 id=\"running\">Running</h3><p>In order to build the image, you have to execute the following command in the directory with the <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p><pre>docker build -t cassandra-graphite .\n</pre><p>Then create the container and attach it to our network:</p><pre>docker run -d -p 9042:9042 --net monitoring-network \\\n    --name cassandra-graphite cassandra-graphite\n</pre><p>Please watch Cassandra logs for errors with <code>docker logs -f cassandra-graphite</code>. Every 60 seconds Cassandra should report its metrics to the corresponding time series database. You can check it in the web UI or using the CLI.</p><p>For Graphite, open <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and look at the tree on the left side:</p><p><img src=\"https://softwaremill.com/images/uploads/2016/07/cassandra-monitoring-2b-graphite-with-metrics.4770ac5d.png\" alt=\"Graphite with Metics\" /></p><p>For InfluxDB, open <code>http://localhost:8083</code>, in the right upper corner set the <code>graphite</code> database (the database created by InfluxDB-Graphite integration is by default called <code>graphite</code>) and execute <code>SHOW MEASUREMENTS</code> query:</p><p><img src=\"https://softwaremill.com/images/uploads/2016/07/cassandra-monitoring-2b-influx-with-metrics.1db87f9e.png\" alt=\"InfluxDB with Metics\" /></p><h2 id=\"grafana\">Grafana</h2><p>Fortunately for Grafana there are official images on <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/grafana/grafana/\">Docker Hub</a>. In this post we are using Grafana 3.1.0. We already have Cassandra running, metrics are being stored in Graphite or InfluxDB, so as the last step we need to visualize them.</p><p>In order to run Grafana execute:</p><pre>docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --net monitoring-network --name grafana grafana/grafana:3.1.0\n</pre><p>Grafana UI should be working under <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. Default user and password is <code>admin</code> and <code>admin</code>.  If you haven't used Grafana before see the <a href=\"http://docs.grafana.org/guides/gettingstarted/\">Getting started</a> guide for UI walkthrough.</p><p>In order to draw a graph you first need to create a Data Source referring to the specific time series database. You can click it through Grafana UI or just execute the API e.g. using <code>curl</code>:</p><h3>Graphite</h3><pre>curl 'http://admin:admin@127.0.0.1:3000/api/datasources' -X POST \\\n-H 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8' \\\n--data-binary '{\"name\":\"graphite\",\"type\":\"graphite\",\"url\":\"http://graphite:80\",\n\"access\":\"proxy\",\"isDefault\":true,\n\"basicAuth\":true,\"basicAuthUser\":\"guest\",\"basicAuthPassword\":\"guest\"}'\n</pre><p>Url <code>http://graphite:80</code> refers to Graphite container hostname.</p><h3>InfluxDB</h3><pre>curl 'http://admin:admin@127.0.0.1:3000/api/datasources' -X POST \\\n-H 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8' \\\n--data-binary '{\"name\":\"influx\",\"type\":\"influxdb\",\"url\":\"http://influxdb:8086\",\n\"access\":\"proxy\",\"isDefault\":true,\"database\":\"graphite\",\"user\":\"admin\",\"password\":\"admin\"}'\n</pre><p>Url <code>http://influxdb:8086</code> refers to InfluxDB container hostname.</p><h3 id=\"graphs\">Graphs</h3><p>Query editors in Grafana differ among various data sources. As you can see below, for Graphite the editor does not display the whole metric list at once, but allows to browse it in a tree-like manner, similarly to the Graphite UI. It is possible to apply a function to a chosen metric. In contrast, for the InfluxDB data source Grafana offers a more SQL-like editor, where all metrics for all nodes are shown in a single list.</p><p><img src=\"https://softwaremill.com/images/uploads/2016/07/cassandra-monitoring-2b-grafana-graphite.de2257ab.png\" alt=\"Graphite Graphing\" />\nGraphite</p><p><img src=\"https://softwaremill.com/images/uploads/2016/07/cassandra-monitoring-2b-grafana-influx.4141607b.png\" alt=\"InfluxDB Graphing\" />\nInfluxDB</p><p>We will focus more on graphing in one of the next parts of this blog series.</p><p>This post does not present a full, production ready configuration. When using Docker, it is important to remember that the data stored inside the container might be lost e.g. when a new version of an application is deployed. That is why it is recommended to use <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/\">Docker Volumes</a> for storing data. For more details please also read the docs of the specific Docker images.</p><p>Additionally be aware that by default Docker <a href=\"http://blog.viktorpetersson.com/post/101707677489/the-dangers-of-ufw-docker\">adds its own <code>iptables</code> rules</a> potentially making the ports exposed by a container accessible from remote hosts.</p><p>In production you must never use default passwords, always remember to change them!</p><p>Monitoring Cassandra using Graphite or InfluxDB (with data sent over Graphite protocol) is very similar. There are differences on the Grafana level, where Graphite integration seems to be a bit more mature. However, Graphite development was practically <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8740021\">dead</a> over the last years. Grafana creators have recently posted <a href=\"http://grafana.org/blog/2016/07/06/dear-graphite-users-and-developers.html\">a piece of information</a> that they want to revive Graphite. In contrast, InfluxDB undergoes a very intensive development process, which e.g. improves performance with almost every release.</p><p>If you'd like to quickly run one of the described variants, see our <a href=\"https://github.com/softwaremill/cassandra-monitoring\">GitHub</a> leveraging <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/products/docker-compose\">Docker Compose</a>.</p><p>In the next part of this series we will focus on the Cassandra-InfluxDB-Grafana stack. We will show improvements over Cassandra-InfluxDB reporting (omitting Graphite protocol) and the resulting advantages on the Grafana level.</p>",

If you would like to read more about general metric collection then you can find a great post on the <a href=\"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/monitoring-101-collecting-data/\">DataDog Blog</a>. Here, we are not going to focus on <strong>what</strong> specifically you can gather from Cassandra, but rather <strong>how</strong>. Again, for details about different Cassandra metrics see the <a href=\"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/how-to-monitor-cassandra-performance-metrics/\">another DataDog  blogpost</a>.\nIn the upcoming parts we are also going to present our open source contributions which make Cassandra monitoring easier and more effective.</p><p>Everybody who uses Cassandra knows <a href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/3.x/cassandra/tools/toolsNodetool.html\"><code>nodetool</code></a>. It is a basic tool, bundled in the Cassandra distribution, for node management and <a href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/3.0/cassandra/operations/opsMonitoring.html?scroll=opsMonitoring__opsMonitoringNodetool\">statistics gathering</a>. Under the hood it is just a Python console application. Nodetool shows <a href=\"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/how-to-monitor-cassandra-performance-metrics/\">cluster status, compactions, bootstrap streams and much more</a>. It is a very important source of information, but it's just a CLI tool without any storage or visualization capabilities. For comfortable monitoring, and to get a better understanding of what hides behind all these numbers, we need something more, preferably with a GUI.</p><p>It is worth noting that Cassandra commiters <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-11939\">find it important</a> to not change output structure of <code>nodetool</code>, because people might have scripts based on them.</p><p><img src=\"https://softwaremill.com/images/uploads/2016/07/cassandra-monitoring-1-nodetool.b6516be0.png\" alt=\"Nodetool\" /></p><h2 id=\"jmx-reporters\">JMX &amp; Reporters</h2><p>Cassandra exposes all its metrics via JMX (by default on port <code>7199</code>).</p><p>JMX can be read e.g. with <code>jconsole</code> or <code>jvisualvm</code> with <code>VisualVM-MBeans plugin</code> (both tools bundled in JDK distributions).\nThe JMX interface also offers some management features! For example under <code>org.apache.cassandra.db.StorageService</code> you can find operations related to node removal, drain, table snapshoting and more.</p><p><img src=\"https://softwaremill.com/images/uploads/2016/07/cassandra-monitoring-1-jmx.21763bc4.png\" alt=\"JMX operations\" /></p><p>Note: by default remote JMX is disabled. If you really need it, you can enable it in <code>cassandra-env.sh</code>.</p><p>For metrics gathering Cassandra internally leverages <a href=\"http://metrics.dropwizard.io/\"><code>io.dropwizard.metrics</code></a>  (only from version <code>2.2</code>, previously library was named <code>com.yammer.metrics</code> and to be more confusing  <code>io.dropwizard.metrics</code> uses <code>com.codahale.metrics</code> package names). Those are the metrics presented via JMX. However, it is possible to access them in a different way. Cassandra 2.0.2 and up allows to configure reporters, so that every configured period Cassandra forwards those metrics e.g. to <a href=\"https://graphiteapp.org/\">Graphite</a>. This is implemented by <a href=\"https://github.com/addthis/metrics-reporter-config\"><code>metrics-reporter-config</code></a> library  (see <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-4430\">CASSANDRA-4430</a>) and provides a nice automatic way to process metrics in different systems, store and display them or check for alarms.</p><p>We will cover the concept of reporters in more detail, in the next part of this blogpost series.</p><h2 id=\"datastax-opscenter\">DataStax OpsCenter</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-opscenter\">OpsCenter</a> is a monitoring and management solution. It is also capable of system monitoring. Every node needs to have an OpsCenter agent installed, which sends data to the main OpsCenter service, which in turn stores them in a Cassandra keyspace. It is recommended to have a separate Cassandra cluster for storing OpsCenter data, so that OpsCenter activity won't be seen among the presented metrics. The application is also able to manage the cluster, add/remove nodes and more. However, the \"free\" OpsCenter is compatible with the open source Cassandra up to version 2.1. The new OpsCenter 6.0 is available only for DataStax Enterprise 4.7+ (based on Cassandra 2.1) and 5.0 (based on Cassandra 3.0). <a href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/landing_page/doc/landing_page/compatibility.html?scroll=compatibilityDocument__opsc-compatibility\">The Documentation</a> shows more detailed compatibility matrix.</p><p>In other words if your cluster uses open source Cassandra 2.2 or 3.x then OpsCenter is not for you.</p><p><img src=\"https://softwaremill.com/images/uploads/2016/07/cassandra-monitoring-1-opscenter.2a9791e8.jpg\" alt=\"OpsCenter\" /><a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/wp-content/themes/datastax-2014-08/images/products/OpsCenter-Screenshot-VisualMonitoringandTuning.jpg\">Source</a></p><h2 id=\"datadog\">DataDog</h2><p>In contrast, <a href=\"https://www.datadoghq.com/\">DataDog</a> is a SaaS solution. It is capable of monitoring, but also supports a lot of other databases and services. However it is <a href=\"https://www.datadoghq.com/pricing/\">free</a> for only no more than 5 hosts with major <a href=\"https://www.datadoghq.com/pricing/\">limitations</a>.</p><p>DataDog requires an agent installed on every Cassandra node. It reads Cassandra <a href=\"https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/blob/master/dogstream/cassandra.py\">logs</a> and metrics using JMX. The agent is <a href=\"https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent\">open source</a> so you can check what exactly it’s doing.</p><p><img src=\"https://softwaremill.com/images/uploads/2016/07/cassandra-monitoring-1-datadog.acf7c047.png\" alt=\"DataDog\" /><a href=\"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/how-to-monitor-cassandra-performance-metrics/\">Source</a></p><h2 id=\"conclusions\">Conclusions</h2><p>There are a lot of options for Cassandra monitoring (and management), however none of them are perfect. If you are still using open source Cassandra 2.1 or below, or DataStax Enterprise, then you can use OpsCenter. If you are open to Cloud and SaaS then DataDog monitoring might be for you. Otherwise, you might be interested in Cassandra reporters and solutions based on <a href=\"https://graphiteapp.org/\">Graphite</a> or <a href=\"https://influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/\">InfluxDB</a> and <a href=\"http://grafana.org/\">Grafana</a> which we will describe in the <a href=\"https://softwaremill.com/cassandra-monitoring-part-2/\">next parts</a> of this blog series.

If you are\nbuilding an application and intend to support upgrading from one version to\nanother, then managing schema changes is essential. If you are lucky, you might\nbe able to get by with running some simple upgrade scripts to bring the schema\nup to date with the new version. This likely will not work however if you\nsupport multiple upgrade paths. For example, suppose we have versions 1 and 2,\nand are introducing version 3 of an application. We want to allow upgrading to\nversion 3 from either 1 or 2 in addition to upgrading from 1 to 2.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>You could add schema upgrade logic to application code, but that is often a\nless that ideal solution as it convolutes the code base. Fortunately, there are\ntool for managing schema changes like <a href=\"http://www.liquibase.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Liquibase</a>,\n<a href=\"http://flywaydb.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flyway</a>, and\n<a href=\"http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Active Record</a> for Ruby\non Rails applications. These tools however, are designed specifically for\nrelational databases. I previously spent time trying to patch Liquibase to\nsupport Cassandra but found that it was not a good fit. Cassalog is designed\nsolely for use with Cassandra, not for any other database systems.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Cassalog is written in Groovy. There are several reasons for this. First,\nGroovy offers great interoperability with Java, making it usable and accessible\nto application running on the JVM. Groovy’s dynamic and meta programming\nfeatures make it easy to write domain specific languages. Groovy has multi-line\nstrings and string interpolation out of the box, both of which can be really\nuseful for writing schema change scripts. Lastly, with Cassalog schema changes\nare not written in XML or JSON. Instead they are written as Groovy scripts\ngiving you the full power and flexibility of Groovy.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2 id=\"user-content-usage\"><a class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#usage\"></a>Usage</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>The Cassalog class is the primary class with which you will interact.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-groovy\"><pre>// Groovy\ndef script = // load schema change script\ndef session = // obtain DataStax driver Session object\ndef cassalog = new Cassalog(session: session)\ncassalog.execute(script)</pre></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-java\"><pre>// Java\nURI script = // load schema change script\nSession session = // obtain DataStax driver Session object\nCassalog cassalog = new Cassalog();\ncassalog.setSession(session);\ncassalog.execute(script);</pre></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>And here is what a cassalog script might look like,</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-groovy\"><pre>createKeyspace {\n  version '0.1'\n  name 'my_keyspace'\n  author 'admin'\n  description 'Set up a keyspace for unit tests'\n}\nschemaChange {\n  version '0.1.1'\n  author 'admin'\n  description 'Create table for storing time series data'\n  cql \"\"\"\nCREATE TABLE metrics (\n    id uuid,\n    time timeuuid,\n    value double,\n    PRIMARY KEY (id, time)\n)\n\"\"\"\n}</pre></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<table><tbody><tr><td>\n</td>\n<td>\nSchema changes are applied in the order that they are declared in the\nscript(s) regardless of the assigned versions.\n</td>\n</tr></tbody></table></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2 id=\"user-content-features\"><a class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#features\"></a>Features</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<ul><li>\n<p>Tagging</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Execute arbitrary Groovy / Java code in schema change scripts</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pass variables to scripts</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Changes can stored across multiple scripts</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Schema change detection</p>\n</li>\n</ul></div>\n<div>\n<h3 id=\"user-content-tagging\"><a class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#tagging\"></a>Tagging</h3>\n<div>\n<p>You can specify tags when running Cassalog, e.g.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-groovy\"><pre>// Groovy\ndef script = // load schema change script\ndef session = // obtain DataStax driver Session object\ndef cassalog = new Cassalog(session: session)\ncassalog.execute(script, ['dev', 'test_data'])</pre></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-java\"><pre>// Java\nURI script = // load schema change script\nSession session = // obtain DataStax driver Session object\nCassalog cassalog = new Cassalog();\ncassalog.setSession(session);\ncassalog.execute(script, Collections.asList(\"dev\", \"test_data\"));</pre></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Cassalog will apply schema changes that have not already been run and that</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<ul><li>\n<p>Dot not specify any tags or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Specify tags and include the <code>dev</code> and <code>test_data</code> tags</p>\n</li>\n</ul></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3 id=\"user-content-execute-arbitrary-code\"><a class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#execute-arbitrary-code\"></a>Execute arbitrary code</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Cassandra is frequently used for time series data.

        "content": "<p>Accenture had the opportunity to stand-up such a streaming analytics platform that delivers insights in near-real time meaning that the time from when sensor data arrives in the system until when insight is delivered happens in the order of seconds.</p><p>Recently, we were asked to help a client manage their water distribution network that had hundreds of thousands of tagged sensors – measuring for example, water flow and pressure.  This client had already embraced analytics for reporting and capacity planning supported by a batch architecture that easily met daily turn-around times to analyze all the data.  From the time sensor readings were ingested, the existing batch architecture could deliver insights into the capacity and health of their water network within 15 minutes.</p> \n<header class=\"articleHeader\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn2.techworld.com/graphics/fallbackimages/30/Big-data-binary-code-futuristic_thumb800.jpg\" alt=\"Big data binary code futuristic\" /></figure></header> \n \n \n<p>The client was interested in adding real-time views onto the health and events along their water network to improve operational efficiency that ultimately improves customer satisfaction.  The objective was to present dynamic views of the current state of the water network refreshed on the order of seconds.</p> \n<p><img class=\"lz\" title=\"Accenture IoT illustration\" alt=\"Accenture IoT illustration\" height=\"858\" width=\"1388\" src=\"https://cdn3.techworld.com/cmsdata/blogentries/3608526/accenture.png\" /></p><noscript>\n<img title=\"Accenture IoT illustration\" alt=\"Accenture IoT illustration\" src=\"https://cdn3.techworld.com/cmsdata/blogentries/3608526/accenture.png\" height=\"858\" width=\"1388\" /></noscript> \n<p> To begin with, we focused on the detection and prediction of leakage events.  Their existing batch architecture was too slow; even a turnaround in minutes wastes precious moments before remediation efforts can begin.  Real-time monitoring combined with predictive algorithms manages operational pressure to proactively reduce high and low pressure spikes that serve as a primary cause of leaks.  These improvements result in avoiding leaks, prolonging the longevity of assets, and reducing disruption to customers.<br /> <br />For streaming analytics, the challenge lies in handling at speed the large number of parallel computations kicked-off by arriving sensor data.  Each time a sensor reading takes part in a number of online algorithms that need to be computed on the order of seconds.  We provide a sample of these algorithms implemented to give some insight into the complexity that the solution handles at real-time.</p> \n<p>First, arriving sensor data is not periodic and is assumed to be unreliable.  Different streams of sensor data come in at different time ticks (or intervals of time) be it on the order of days, minutes, or seconds.  Before computations and visualizations occur, we first need processing to normalize streamed data across different sources according to common time ticks (e.g., every 5 seconds or 1 minute). In the event of missed sensor readings, calculations estimate the values for the missed value to allow for operations to progress, but then require additional calculations for backfilling and reconciliation upon recovery of lost data (e.g., when network outage is restored or when a sensor comes back online).   </p> \n \n<p>To do prediction, an algorithm projects readings forward into time against a function.  An online curve-fitting algorithm continuously trains the function based on the arriving streamed data.  </p> \n<p>Further analytics includes processing complex events like when a series of sensor readings that convey various high and low thresholds on critical pressure points.  These indicate detection of a leakage event, which triggers follow-up actions.  <br />In addition, we implemented more complex computations like those for estimating impact of the most recent usage and operations on reservoir supply that combine streamed data with historical data (e.g., over the past 7-days) fetched from the data store.</p> \n<p>To handle these computations, we implemented a lambda architecture pattern  based on that of many of today’s internet companies like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.  In the same way that these internet companies balance real-time analytics on live social feeds against batch analytics over a vast quantity of historical user data, we do the same with balancing streaming and batch analytics on sensor data.  To that end, we added a parallel data flow for streaming analytics to the existing batch flow.</p> \n<p>To start, we created data publishers for pushing data from the client’s sensor network into our platform.  For this client, it meant getting data from their <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.osisoft.com/\">OSI Pi historian</a> that serves as a gateway for a majority of the sensor data and for REST APIs.  We ingested this data into a stream processor<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/\"> Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) Kinesis</a>.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://spark.apache.org/\">Apache Spark Streaming</a> runs computations for real-time detection and analytics, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/\">AWS Dynamo</a> and stores the time-series data and results of our processing.  A Java API tier obfuscates data store interfaces for querying the results that are then visualized in a dashboard built using D3.</p> \n<p>Over the course of six weeks, the team created the reference implementation for the water network.  For the initial build-out we leveraged as-a-Service Amazon Web Services components that were ready as-a-Service for agility sake.  The team then hardened this architecture, re-platformed onto Apache Cassandra and Kafka to allow for an on-premise option in addition to our AWS cloud-based implementation, load tested it with ingestion data at over 3000 events per second, and packaged its components for reuse.  </p> \n<p>The result is an architecture proven for leakage detection in water networks, but is now prebuilt and ready to onboard new streaming analytics applications and domains.</p> \n \n \n<p> The next opportunity can reuse the same architecture and even the same sensor health algorithms (e.g., for dealing with unreliable sensor data) accelerating the time to standup a solution by allowing the project to focus on onboarding the domain specific algorithms.<br /> </p> \n<p><strong> Posted by Teresa Tung, Ph.D.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.accenture.com\">Accenture </a>Technology Labs' Next Generation Software Architecture R&amp;D group</strong></p>",

        "content": "<img src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/developerblog//wp-content/uploads/fortis-radio-to-text-spark-450x300.png\" alt=\"image\" /><p>The <a href=\"http://aka.ms/fortis\">Fortis project</a> is a social data ingestion, analysis, and visualization platform. Originally developed in collaboration with the <a href=\"https://www.unocha.org/\">United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</a> (UN OCHA), Fortis provides planners and scientists with tools to gain insight from social media, public websites and custom data sources.  UN OCHA mobilizes humanitarian aid for crises such as famines, epidemics, and war.</p><p>To understand crisis situations and formulate appropriate mitigations, UN OCHA needs access to tremendous amounts of data and intelligence, from a wide range of sources including newspapers, social media, and radio.</p><p>Fortis already has support for social media and web content, but UN OCHA wanted to be able to incorporate content from local radio broadcasts. Working together, we created a solution based on Spark Streaming to extract textual information from radio in near real-time by developing a new <a href=\"https://github.com/CatalystCode/SpeechToText-WebSockets-Java/\">Java client</a> for Azure Cognitive Services’ speech-to-text APIs. This code story delves into our Fortis solution by providing examples of Spark Streaming custom receivers needed to consume Azure Cognitive Service’s speech-to-text API and showing how to integrate with Azure Cognitive Service’s speech-to-text protocol.</p><h2>A Spark Streaming pipeline for analyzing radio</h2><p>We covered the Fortis pipeline in a <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/developerblog/2017/05/10/graphql-providing-context-into-global-crisiss-and-social-public-data-sources/\">previous code story</a>. Below is a brief summary of the pipeline:</p><ol><li>Real-time data sources (such as Facebook, Twitter, and news feeds) generate events</li><li>Events are filtered and analyzed by Spark Streaming</li><li>Spark stores events and aggregations in Cassandra for reporting uses</li></ol><p>A NodeJS and GraphQL services layer sends the data from Cassandra to a ReactJS dashboard.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-4891\" src=\"https://codestoryedge.azureedge.net/developerblog/wp-content/uploads/radio-codestory-fortis-diagram-1024x447.png\" alt=\"Overview of the Fortis pipeline\" width=\"780\" height=\"340\" srcset=\"https://www.microsoft.com/developerblog//wp-content/uploads/radio-codestory-fortis-diagram-1024x447.png 1024w, https://www.microsoft.com/developerblog//wp-content/uploads/radio-codestory-fortis-diagram-300x131.png 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/developerblog//wp-content/uploads/radio-codestory-fortis-diagram-768x335.png 768w\" /></p><p>To add radio analysis to this pipeline, we made three simplifying assumptions:</p><ul><li>The raw radio stream is freely accessible on the web via HTTP</li><li>The content published via the radio stream can be discretized into short segments</li><li>The radio content can be meaningfully analyzed via its textual transcription</li></ul><p>Once framed in this way, we see that we need two pieces to ingest radio into a Spark Streaming pipeline:</p><ol><li>A mechanism to get transcribed radio content into our Spark cluster for processing via our text-based analyses <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/developerblog/2017/05/10/graphql-providing-context-into-global-crisiss-and-social-public-data-sources/\">as described in a previous code story</a></li><li>A process to receive audio from a radio feed (such as the <a href=\"http://bbcwssc.ic.llnwd.net/stream/bbcwssc_mp1_ws-einws\">BBC World Service</a> or Radio France International) and convert it to text</li></ol><p>The following sections will cover each of these pieces.</p><h2>Consuming arbitrary APIs via Spark Streaming custom receivers</h2><p>Spark’s <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-custom-receivers.html\">custom receivers</a> are a powerful mechanism to turn APIs into real-time data sources for Spark Streaming. A custom receiver needs to implement just a few methods. For example, in Scala:</p><p>After we define our custom receiver, we can now turn its underlying data source into a Spark stream that is easy to consume via the usual high-level Spark APIs:</p><p>We make heavy use of custom receivers in the Fortis project as a simple way to turn APIs into streaming data-sources. Fortis has published packages to integrate with the <a href=\"https://github.com/CatalystCode/streaming-facebook\">Facebook API</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/CatalystCode/streaming-reddit\">Reddit API</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/CatalystCode/streaming-instagram\">Instagram API</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/CatalystCode/streaming-bing\">Bing News API</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/CatalystCode/streaming-rss-html\">RSS feeds</a>. Similarly, the radio-to-text functionality described below is wrapped in a <a href=\"https://github.com/CatalystCode/project-fortis-spark/tree/f2b8d2dec955c5f78eed00ff884a86a40b5b255b/src/main/scala/com/microsoft/partnercatalyst/fortis/spark/sources/streamwrappers/radio\">custom radio receiver</a> to integrate it into our Spark pipeline.</p><h2>Converting radio to text in near real-time</h2><p>After solving the problem of how to integrate custom data sources into Spark, we next require a solution to convert a stream of audio, such as from an online radio broadcast, to a stream of text.</p><p>Azure Cognitive Services has been offering speech-to-text capabilities for more than 10 languages for a long time via the <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/cognitive-services/speech/\">Bing Speech API</a>. However, the API is based on a request-response paradigm which is not suited to our streaming use case as it would require us to buffer large audio clips in the radio receiver, send the chunks to the speech-to-text service and wait for a transcribed response. This approach would introduce latency and HTTP request overhead.</p><p>However, Azure Cognitive Services recently published a <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech/api-reference-rest/websocketprotocol\">speech-to-text protocol</a> that works via WebSockets which are well suited for a streaming scenario. We simply open a single bi-directional communication channel via a WebSocket connection and use it to continuously send audio to the speech-to-text service and receive back the transcribed results via the same channel.</p><p>A reference implementation of this speech-to-text approach via WebSockets exists for <a href=\"https://github.com/Azure-Samples/SpeechToText-WebSockets-Javascript\">Javascript</a> and an unofficial implementation exists for <a href=\"https://github.com/noopkat/ms-bing-speech-service\">NodeJS</a>. We created a new implementation of the protocol in <a href=\"https://github.com/CatalystCode/SpeechToText-WebSockets-Java/\">Java</a> so that we can leverage the WebSocket speech-to-text from our Scala-on-Spark pipeline.</p><h3>How does the WebSocket speech-to-text protocol work?</h3><p>After creating a Bing Speech API resource in Azure and noting the access key, we’re ready to start implementing the speech-to-text WebSocket protocol.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4892\" src=\"https://codestoryedge.azureedge.net/developerblog/wp-content/uploads/radio-codestory-azure-dashboard.png\" alt=\"Creating the required resources in Azure\" width=\"564\" height=\"271\" srcset=\"https://codestoryedge.azureedge.net/developerblog/wp-content/uploads/radio-codestory-azure-dashboard.png 564w, https://codestoryedge.azureedge.net/developerblog/wp-content/uploads/radio-codestory-azure-dashboard-300x144.png 300w\" /></p><p>The speech-to-text WebSocket protocol specifies three phases that clients must implement:</p><ol><li>Establishing the speech-to-text WebSocket connection</li><li>Transcribing audio via the speech-to-text WebSocket</li><li>Closing the speech-to-text WebSocket connection</li></ol><p>In the first phase, the client identifies itself with the speech-to-text service and establishes the WebSocket connection. After identification, the client is free to send audio to the speech-to-text service and receive back transcriptions. Eventually, the speech-to-text service will detect the end of the audio stream. When the end is detected, the speech-to-text service will send the client an alert that the audio stream is done getting messages. The client will respond to the service’s end-of-the-audio message by closing the WebSocket speech-to-text connection.</p><p>The full end-to-end flow is illustrated in the diagram below and each phase is described in more detail in the following sections.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-4893\" src=\"https://codestoryedge.azureedge.net/developerblog/wp-content/uploads/radio-codestory-tts-pipeline-1024x807.png\" alt=\"WebSocket speech-to-text messages flow\" width=\"780\" height=\"615\" srcset=\"https://www.microsoft.com/developerblog//wp-content/uploads/radio-codestory-tts-pipeline-1024x807.png 1024w, https://www.microsoft.com/developerblog//wp-content/uploads/radio-codestory-tts-pipeline-300x236.png 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/developerblog//wp-content/uploads/radio-codestory-tts-pipeline-768x605.png 768w, https://www.microsoft.com/developerblog//wp-content/uploads/radio-codestory-tts-pipeline.png 1348w\" /></p><h4>Phase 1: Establishing the speech-to-text WebSocket connection</h4><p>To kick off a speech-to-text session, we need to establish a connection with the Bing speech-to-text WebSocket service and identify our client via our API token for the Bing service. Note that all authentication and configuration information must be passed in via query parameters on the WebSocket connection URL since many WebSocket clients don’t have support for headers that would typically be used for sending information like API tokens. For example, using the Java <a href=\"https://github.com/TakahikoKawasaki/nv-websocket-client\">NV WebSocket client</a>, we’d connect to the speech-to-text service as follows:</p><p>After the WebSocket connection is established, we must send additional identifying information about our client (like the operating system used, the audio source being transcribed, etc.) to the speech-to-text service via a WebSocket text message and then we’re ready to transcribe audio:</p><h4>Phase 2: Transcribing audio via the speech-to-text WebSocket</h4><p>Once the client has successfully identified itself with the speech-to-text service, it can start sending chunks of audio for transcription, via binary WebSocket messages:</p><p>The messages follow a specific schema:</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-4894\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/developerblog//wp-content/uploads/radio-codestory-tts-audio-message-schema-1024x592.png\" alt=\"Format of speech-to-text audio transfer messages\" width=\"780\" height=\"451\" srcset=\"https://codestoryedge.azureedge.net/developerblog/wp-content/uploads/radio-codestory-tts-audio-message-schema-1024x592.png 1024w, https://codestoryedge.azureedge.net/developerblog/wp-content/uploads/radio-codestory-tts-audio-message-schema-300x173.png 300w, https://codestoryedge.azureedge.net/developerblog/wp-content/uploads/radio-codestory-tts-audio-message-schema-768x444.png 768w\" /></p><p>Note that the audio data sent to the speech-to-text service must be single-channel mono WAV audio sampled at 16kHz with 16 bits per sample. The speech-to-text service does not validate the format of the audio messages and will silently return incorrect transcriptions on receipt of messages with malformed encodings.</p><p>Most online radio is in MP3 rather than WAV format, making an audio format conversion step necessary for the radio input to be processed by the speech-to-text service. The Java ecosystem has a lack of great open source, permissively licensed streaming MP3 decoders; as a result, our client resorts to converting small batches of MP3 audio to WAV on disk using the <a href=\"https://github.com/pdudits/soundlibs/tree/master/jlayer/src/javazoom/jl/converter\">javazoom converter</a> and then <a href=\"https://github.com/CatalystCode/SpeechToText-WebSockets-Java/blob/182cb301d41427a7a8dd9221ad91aa7922f2d559/src/main/java/com/github/catalystcode/fortis/speechtotext/websocket/MessageSender.java#L58-L101\">resampling</a> the WAV using the javax.sound APIs with the <a href=\"http://www.tritonus.org\">Tritonus plugin</a>. Hopefully, in the future, the trip to disk will be made unnecessary by moving to a streaming or in-memory MP3 decoder.</p><p>After the client starts sending audio messages to the speech-to-text service, the service will transcribe the audio and send the transcription results back to the client. Via WebSocket, transcriptions will be sent with a JSON payload for the client to parse and process. Note that the service may choose to batch multiple input audio messages sent by the client into a single output transcription message returned to the client.</p><h4>Phase 3: Closing the speech-to-text WebSocket connection</h4><p>When the client wishes to close the connection with the speech-to-text service, it must execute three steps in sequence:</p><ol><li>Send an audio message as described in Phase 2, but with a zero-byte audio payload</li><li>Send telemetry as a JSON WebSocket text message about its perception of the speech-to-text service’s performance</li><li>Shut down the WebSocket connection</li></ol><p>Sending the connection-end telemetry is like the client-information telemetry described in Phase 1 above. The schema for the JSON payload of the message is <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech/api-reference-rest/websocketprotocol#telemetry-schema\">well documented</a>.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>In many parts of the world, essential information is broadcast via traditional sources such as radio. To formulate effective crisis response plans, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs needs to be able to access and analyze these data sources in a timely manner.</p><p>To solve this problem, we created a <a href=\"https://github.com/CatalystCode/SpeechToText-WebSockets-Java/\">Java client</a> for the Azure Cognitive Services <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/cognitive-services/speech/\">speech-to-text</a> WebSocket protocol. We then fed the transcribed radio into a pipeline based on Spark Streaming for further analysis, augmentation, and aggregation.

        "content": "<p>If you are a big data analyst, or build big data solutions for fast analytical queries, you are likely familiar with columnar storage technologies.  The open source <a href=\"http://parquet.io\">Parquet</a> file format for HDFS saves space and powers query engines from Spark to Impala and more, while cloud solutions like Amazon Redshift use columnar storage to speed up queries and minimize I/O.  Being a file format, Parquet is much more challenging to work with directly for real-time data ingest.  For applications like IoT, time-series, and event data analytics, many developers have turned to NoSQL databases such as Apache Cassandra, due to their combination of high write scalability and the ease of using an idempotent, primary key-based database API.  Most NoSQL databases are not designed for fast, bulk analytical scans, but instead for highly concurrent key-value lookups.  What is missing is a solution that combines the ease of use of a database API, the scalability of NoSQL databases, with columnar storage technology for fast analytics.</p><h2 id=\"introducing-filodb--distributed--versioned--columnar\">Introducing FiloDB.  Distributed.  Versioned.  Columnar.</h2><p>I am excited to announce FiloDB, a new open-source distributed columnar database from <a href=\"http://www.tuplejump.com\">TupleJump</a>.  FiloDB is designed to ingest streaming data of various types, including machine, event, and time-series data, and run very fast analytical queries over them.  In four-letter acronyms, it is an OLAP solution, not OLTP.</p><ul><li><strong>Distributed</strong> - FiloDB is designed from the beginning to run on best-of-breed distributed, scale-out storage platforms such as Apache Cassandra.  Queries run in parallel in Apache Spark for scale-out ad-hoc analysis.</li>\n  <li><strong>Columnar</strong> - FiloDB brings breakthrough performance levels for analytical queries by using a columnar storage layout with different space-saving techniques like dictionary compression.  The performance is comparable to Parquet, and one to two orders of magnitude faster than Spark on Cassandra 2.x for analytical queries.  For the POC performance comparison, please see the <a href=\"http://github.com/velvia/cassandra-gdelt\">cassandra-gdelt</a> repo.</li>\n  <li><strong>Versioned</strong> - At the same time, row-level, column-level operations and built in versioning gives FiloDB far more flexibility than can be achieved using file-based technologies like Parquet alone.</li>\n</ul><p><img src=\"http://velvia.github.io/images/filodb_architecture.png\" alt=\"FiloDB architecture\" /></p><h2 id=\"your-database-for-fast-streaming--big-data\">Your Database for Fast Streaming + Big Data</h2><p>FiloDB is designed for <strong>streaming</strong> applications.  Enable easy exactly-once ingestion from Apache Kafka for streaming events, time series, and IoT applications - yet enable extremely fast ad-hoc analysis using the ease of use of SQL.  Each row is keyed by a partition and sort key, and writes using the same key are idempotent.  Idempotent writes enables exactly-once storage of event data.  FiloDB does the hard work of keeping data stored in an efficient and read-optimized, sorted format.</p><h2 id=\"filodb--cassandra--spark--lightning-fast-analytics\">FiloDB + Cassandra + Spark = Lightning-fast Analytics</h2><p>FiloDB leverages <a href=\"https://cassandra.apache.org/\">Apache Cassandra</a> as its storage engine, and <a href=\"http://spark.apache.org\">Apache Spark</a> as its compute layer.  Apache Cassandra is one of the most widely deployed, rock-solid distributed databases in use today, with very well understood operational characteristics.  Many folks are combining Apache Spark with their Cassandra tables for much richer analytics on their Cassandra data than is possible with just the native Cassandra CQL interface.  However, loading massive amounts of data from Cassandra into Spark can still be very slow, especially for analytics and ad-hoc queries such as averaging or computing the correlation between two columns of data.  This is because Cassandra CQL tables stores data in a row-oriented manner.  FiloDB brings the benefits of efficient columnar storage and the flexibility and richness of Apache Spark to the rock solid storage technology of Cassandra, speeding up analytical queries by up to 100x over Cassandra 2.x.</p><h2 id=\"easy-ingestion--sql--jdbc--spark-ml\">Easy Ingestion + SQL + JDBC + Spark ML</h2><p>FiloDB uses Apache Spark SQL and DataFrames as the main query mechanism.  This lets you run familiar SQL queries over your data, and easily connect tools such as Tableau to query your data, using Spark’s JDBC connector.  At the same time, the full power of Spark is available for your data, including the machine learning MLlib library and GraphX for graph processing.</p><p>Ingesting data is also very easy through Spark DataFrames.  This means you can easily ingest data from any JDBC data source, Parquet and Avro files, Cassandra tables, and much, much, more.  This includes easily inserting data from Spark Streaming and Apache Kafka.</p><h2 id=\"simplify-your-analytics-stack--filodb--smack-for-everything\">Simplify your Analytics Stack.  FiloDB + SMACK for everything.</h2><p>Use Kafka + Spark + Cassandra + FiloDB to power your entire Lamba architecture implementation.  There is no need to implement a complex Lambda dual ingestion pipeline with both Cassandra and Hadoop!   You can use the <a href=\"http://noetl.org\">SMACK</a> stack (Spark/Scala, Mesos, Akka, Cassandra, Kafka) for a much bigger portion of your analytics stack than before, reducing infrastructure investment.</p><h2 id=\"whats-in-the-name\">What’s in the name?</h2><p><img src=\"http://velvia.github.io/images/Dantat.jpg\" alt=\"Dan tat\" /></p><p>I love desserts, and Filo dough is an essential ingredient.  One can think of columns and versions of data as layers, and FiloDB wrapping the layers in a yummy high-performance analytical database engine.</p><h2 id=\"proudly-built-with-the-typesafe-stack\">Proudly built with the Typesafe Stack</h2><p>FiloDB is built with the Typesafe reactive stack for high-performance distributed computing and asynchronous I/O - Scala, Spark, and <a href=\"http://akka.io\">Akka</a>.</p><h2 id=\"come-to-the-talk-at-cassandra-summit\">Come to the Talk at Cassandra Summit!</h2><p>If you’d like to learn more, I encourage you to come on over to <a href=\"http://cassandrasummit-datastax.com/?source=\">Cassandra Summit</a> in Santa Clara, where I’ll be speaking about FiloDB and Spark and Cassandra, on Thursday September 24th at the Santa Clara Convention Center!  Or feel free to reach out.  The repo and more details such as the roadmap will be unveiled at the talk.</p>",

In addition, the names of the columns have been shortened to use up less disk space.</p>\n<p>Space taken up by all records: 2.2GB</p>\n<table><thead><tr><th align=\"left\">What</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Time</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Records/sec</th>\n</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\">Ingestion from CSV</td>\n<td align=\"left\">3190 s</td>\n<td align=\"left\">1300 rec/s</td>\n</tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Read every column</td>\n<td align=\"left\">941 s</td>\n<td align=\"left\">4417 rec/s</td>\n</tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Read 1 col (monthYear)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">707 s</td>\n<td align=\"left\">5880 rec/s</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><p>Oh no, what happened?  It seems it is slower to query, and it takes up more space on disk as well (logically, wide rows takes up more space uncompressed due to compound column names).  This is actually not entirely surprising, because reading only one column from such a layout, due to the way Cassandra lays out its data, essentially means having to scan all the data in a partition, and using clustering keys is inefficient because of how Cassandra prefixes clustering keys to the column names.  With the skinny layout, Cassandra is actually able to skip part of the row when reading.</p>\n<p>However, let's say you were not scanning the whole table but instead had a WHERE clause to filter on your partition key.  In this case, this layout would be a huge win over the other one -- only data from one partition needs to be read.  Thus, pick a layout based on your needs.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"user-content-compact-storage\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#compact-storage\"></a>COMPACT STORAGE</h3>\n<p>COMPACT STORAGE is the old Cassandra 0.x - 1.x way of storing things - write your record as a blob of your choice (JSON, Protobuf, etc.) and Cassandra writes it as a single cell (physical row, column, blob).  It is not supposed to be supported going forward.  You need to parse the blob yourself, and the entire blob must be read.  If you use Protobuf or other binary format, then CQLSH won't show you the contents (in this case we are using a trick and joining the text fields together using a special \\001 character, which shows up in a different color).  Writes are fast, but reads are still much slower than columnar layout.</p>\n<p>Disk space: 260M</p>\n<table><thead><tr><th align=\"left\">What</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Time</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Records/sec</th>\n</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\">Ingestion from CSV</td>\n<td align=\"left\">78.6 s</td>\n<td align=\"left\">52877 rec/s</td>\n</tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Read every column</td>\n<td align=\"left\">81.8 s</td>\n<td align=\"left\">50850 rec/s</td>\n</tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Read 1 col (monthYear)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">81.8 s</td>\n<td align=\"left\">50850 rec/s</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><h3><a id=\"user-content-columnar-layout\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#columnar-layout\"></a>Columnar Layout</h3>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-sql\"><pre>CREATE TABLE data (\n  dataset text,\n  version int,\n  shard int,\n  columnname text,\n  rowid int,\n  bytes blob,\n  PRIMARY KEY ((dataset, version, shard), columnname, rowid)\n)</pre></div>\n<p>This layout places values of the same column from different rows together, and also serializes multiple row values into one cell.</p>\n<p>Dictionary encoding enabled for about 75% of column chunks\n(auto-detection with a 50% cardinality threshold for enabling dictionary encoding)</p>\n<p>Space taken up by records:  266MB .... !!!\n(LZ4 Compressed SSTable size; uncompressed actual ByteBuffers are 918MB)</p>\n<table><thead><tr><th align=\"left\">What</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Time</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Records/sec</th>\n</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\">Ingestion from CSV</td>\n<td align=\"left\">93.0 s</td>\n<td align=\"left\">43324 rec/s</td>\n</tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Read every column</td>\n<td align=\"left\">8.6 s</td>\n<td align=\"left\">468,980 rec/s</td>\n</tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Read 1 col (monthYear)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.23 s</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>17.4 million rec/s</strong></td>\n</tr></tbody></table><p>The speedup and compactness is shocking.</p>\n<ul><li>On ingest - roughly 20-35x faster and 7x less disk space (of course this is from CSV with essentially no primary key, append only, probably not realistic)</li>\n<li>On reads - 42x to 59x faster for reads of all columns, and 355 - 2190x faster for read of a single column\n<ul><li>Granted, the speedup is for parsing an integer column, which is the most compact and benefits the most from efficient I/O; parsing a string column will not be quite as fast (though dictionary-encoded columns are very fast in deserialization)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Dictionary encoding saves a huge amount of space, cutting the actual storage\nspace to one-third of the columnar one, both uncompressed and compressed.

There are two helper scripts: <code>split_csv.sh</code> helps break up a big CSV into smaller CSVs with header intact, and <code>socrata_pointify.sh</code> adds a point column from lat and long columns.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"user-content-spark-on-cassandra\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#spark-on-cassandra\"></a>Spark on Cassandra</h2>\n<p>The above can also be used to compare Spark on Cassandra reads.  First start up the spark shell, like this (we ensure there is only one thread for all tests for an even comparison):</p>\n<pre>bin/spark-shell \\\n              --packages com.datastax.spark:spark-cassandra-connector_2.10:1.4.0-M3 \\\n              --conf spark.cassandra.connection.host=127.0.0.1 --conf spark.cassandra.input.split.size_in_mb=256 \\\n              --conf spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=4 \\\n              --driver-memory 5G --master \"local[1]\"\n</pre>\n<p>The split size is to ensure that the GDELT2 wide row table doesn't get too many splits when reading.  This is really tricky to configure by the way, as it is global but you will probably need different settings for different tables.</p>\n<p>To load a Cassandra table into a Spark DataFrame, do something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-scala\"><pre>val df = sqlContext.read.format(\"org.apache.spark.sql.cassandra\").\n                    option(\"table\", \"gdelt2\").\n                    option(\"keyspace\", \"test\").load\ndf.registerTempTable(\"gdelt\")</pre></div>\n<p>Here are the queries used.  Query 1:</p>\n<pre>df.select(count(\"numarticles\")).show\n</pre>\n<p>Query 2:</p>\n<pre>sqlContext.sql(\"SELECT a1name, AVG(avgtone) AS tone FROM gdelt GROUP BY a1name ORDER BY tone DESC\").show\n</pre>\n<p>Query 3:</p>\n<pre>sqlContext.sql(\"SELECT AVG(avgtone), MIN(avgtone), MAX(avgtone) FROM gdelt WHERE MonthYear = 198012\").show\n</pre>\n<p>NOTE: the above are for querying the Cassandra CQL tables, in which the code shortens column names for performance and storage compactness reasons.  For Parquet and FiloDB, use the regular, capitalized column names (<code>Actor1Name</code> instead of <code>a1name</code>, <code>AvgTone</code> instead of <code>avgtone</code>, etc.)</p>\n<p>TODO: instructions for querying the COMPACT STORAGE table</p>\n<p>For testing Spark SQL cached tables, do the following:</p>\n<pre>sqlContext.cacheTable(\"gdelt\")\nsqlContext.sql(\"select avg(numarticles), avg(avgtone) from gdelt group by a1name\").show\n</pre>\n<p>NOTE: For any DataFrame DSL (Scala) queries, make sure to get back a new DataFrame after the <code>cacheTable</code> operation, like this: <code>val df1 = sqlContext.table(\"gdelt\")</code>.  The cached DataFrame reference is not the same as the original!</p>\n<p>For FiloDB, the table is loaded just a tiny bit differently:</p>\n<pre>df = sqlContext.read.format(\"filodb.spark\").option(\"dataset\", \"gdelt\").option(\"splits_per_node\", \"1\").load\n</pre>\n<p>For Parquet, it is even more straightforward:</p>\n<pre>df = sqlContext.load(\"/path/to/my/1979-1984.parquet\")\n</pre>\n<p>For comparisons, I generated the Parquet file from one of the above Cassandra tables (not the COMPACT STORAGE one) by saving it out, like this:</p>\n<pre>df.save(\"/path/to/my/1979-1984.parquet\")\n</pre>\n</article>",

And so in 2018, it's <a href=\"https://cassandra.apache.org/\">Apache Cassandra's</a> turn. Today, Apache Cassandra has morphed into a modest ecosystem where there is one principle commercial platform supplier -- <a href=\"http://datastax.com/\">DataStax</a> -- supplemented by a <a href=\"https://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/ThirdPartySupport\">small collection of companies</a> delivering third-party support. It combines the versatility of a table-oriented database with the speed and efficiency of a key-value store.</p><p>But make no mistake about it -- the fact that there aren't a dozen vendors of Cassandra distros doesn't hide up the fact that Cassandra is a very popular database. It is one of a quartet of NoSQL databases that rank in <a href=\"https://db-engines.com/en/ranking\">db-Engine's</a> top ten. And in itself, Cassandra has carved out a niche for continuous online systems that can carry up to PBytes of data. Like other \"wide column\" databases that began life as key-value stores, Cassandra was first known for fast writes, but over the years, read performance has caught up.</p><p>For instance, when you get film recommendations served up on Netflix, they come from an application running on Cassandra. It has carved presence with maintaining of online user profiles, shopping carts, fraud detection, and increasingly, real-time mobile and IoT applications. For that matter, so have most of Cassandra's prime NoSQL competitors like <a href=\"https://mongodb.com/\">MongoDB</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/\">DynamoDB</a>, and <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/\">Cosmos DB</a>.</p><p>As this is 10th birthday time, it makes sense to look at Cassandra's beginnings. The story is a familiar one. An Internet giant -- Facebook -- needed a more scalable, always-on database alternative for its inbox feature and created Cassandra back in 2008 based on the <a href=\"https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf\">Dynamo paper</a> published by Amazon. After open sourcing it, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbellis/\">Jonathan Ellis</a>, an engineer at Rackspace at the time, saw its potential as a distributed database for powering cloud applications, and a year later, drew venture backing to cofound what is now DataStax with then-colleague <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattpfeil/\">Matt Pfeil</a>.</p><p>The biggest source of confusion early on was with Hadoop. Because of some <a href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/03/23/cassandra_mashed_with_hadoop/\">ridiculous historical coincidences</a>, Cassandra got lumped into the Hadoop project where it still appears on the <a href=\"http://hadoop.apache.org/\">Apache project page</a>. That implies that Cassandra is an in-kind replacement for <a href=\"https://hbase.apache.org/\">HBase</a>. Well kinda and kinda not. Although both were initially designed to run as online production systems for big data, HBase requires HDFS, YARN, and Zookeeper to run, whereas Cassandra doesn't require Hadoop components and runs on its own cluster. Then there are other architectural differences, such as that HBase runs with Hadoop hierarchical topology, whereas Cassandra works in more of a peer-to-peer mode.</p><p><strong>Comparison to the usual suspects</strong></p><p>Hadoop flirtations notwithstanding, how does Cassandra differentiate from the usual NoSQL suspects? We'll start with the biggest differentiator: query language. Cassandra also has a <a href=\"https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cql/\">query language</a> that is much more like SQL compared to most rivals except <a href=\"https://www.couchbase.com/products/n1ql\">Couchbase</a>.</p>\n    <section class=\"sharethrough-top\" data-component=\"medusaContentRecommendation\" data-medusa-content-recommendation-options=\"{&quot;promo&quot;:&quot;promo_ZD_recommendation_sharethrough_top_in_article_desktop&quot;,&quot;spot&quot;:&quot;dfp-in-article&quot;}\">\n    </section><p>Compared to MongoDB, Cassandra was more write-friendly, but as both databases matured, differences in read and write performance are no longer as stark. Cassandra was initially designed as a tabular database for key-value data (compared to MongoDB's more object-like model), but in time was evolved to accommodate JSON documents. There are still basic differences in database topology: Cassandra was designed for higher availability writes with its multi-master architecture, whereas MongoDB uses a single master, but suggests <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/active-active-application-architectures-with-mongodb\">managing sharding</a> for higher availability writes.</p><p>Among cloud-native counterparts, Cassandra shares lineage with Amazon DynamoDB. A detailed comparison can be found <a href=\"https://www.beyondthelines.net/databases/dynamodb-vs-cassandra/\">here</a>. But at high level, the obvious difference is where they run: DynamoDB only runs in <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/\">AWS</a> as a managed service (and likewise for Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB on <a href=\"http://azure.microsoft.com/\">Azure</a>); Cassandra, on the other hand, can run anywhere, but as managed service, <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-managed-cloud\" target=\"_blank\">DataStax Managed Cloud Service</a> has only been introduced recently. Cassandra and DynamoDB both let you tune consistency levels -- Cassandra offers five options for consistency while DynamoDB narrows it down to two (eventual or strong). </p><p>Compared to Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB, the biggest difference is multi-model that is core to the Azure offering; by comparison, the commercial version of Cassandra -- <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise\">DataStax Enterprise</a> -- is just starting on this road, as it is still integrating its graph model.</p><p><strong>Are we in a post-relational world?</strong></p><p>Given that four NoSQL databases have now made it to the mainstream (based on developer interest charted by db-Engines), one would think that the matter has been settled about the role that these platforms play. One would be wrong.</p><p>There's still healthy debate. On one side, there's the irrational exuberance of being in a <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/2018/07/cassandras-journey-via-the-five-stages-of-grief\">post-relational world</a>. Yes, NoSQL databases have become very popular among database developers. And yes, DataStax does have its share of <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Oracle</a> run-ins, but these are going to be wins from outside of Oracle's core back office base. Actually, DataStax and Oracle are frenemies, as <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise\" target=\"_blank\">DataStax Enterprise</a> (DSE) is one of the first third-party databases to become <a href=\"https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/datastax-certified-nosql-cassandra-clusters-on-bare-metal-cloud\" target=\"_blank\">officially supported</a> in the Oracle Public Cloud's <a href=\"https://cloud.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure\" target=\"_blank\">bare metal services</a>, but we digress.</p><p>Fortuitously, having spoken with  <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/author/patrickdatastax-com\" target=\"_blank\">Patrick McFadin</a>, the five-stages-of-grief author, we've found his insights to be far more nuanced than his blog post would suggest. But there are many others taking more extreme views based on the notion of <a href=\"https://www.techopedia.com/2/32000/trends/big-data/why-the-world-is-moving-toward-nosql-databases\">big data becoming the mainstream</a>. On the other side, there's the constituency that still believes that <a href=\"https://read.acloud.guru/serverless-superheroes-lynn-langit-on-big-data-nosql-and-google-versus-aws-f4427dc8679c\">NoSQL is overhyped</a>.</p><p>Reality is much grayer. The fact that NoSQL databases like Cassandra allow schema to vary does not mean that they lack schema, or that developers should not bother with optimizing the database for specific types of schema. In a NoSQL database, schema still matters and so does table layout. Even if you don't design the data model exactly for the queries that you're going throw at it, you still need to consider which data the app will touch when laying out the tables.</p><p>Don't count relational out either. If your application or use case requires strict ACID guarantees and data with referential integrity, relational is going to be your choice. If the use case involves complex analytical queries, you have a couple options. You could go the NoSQL route if you denormalize the data to improve performance; design the application so you don't have to rely on complex table joins; and take advantage of the Spark connectors that are becoming checkbox items with commercial NoSQL databases like DataStax Enterprise. But if the purpose of the database is solely for analytics, NoSQL won't be the right route.</p><figure class=\"image  image-medium shortcode-image\"><img src=\"https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/07/21/c30e5d5f-c52d-409a-9076-4db9a09329a0/resize/370xauto/5bb3013fbc6e0bea9b81942248c45bea/datastaxlogo.png\" class=\"\" alt=\"datastaxlogo.png\" height=\"auto\" width=\"370\" /></figure><p><strong>DataStax and Cassandra today</strong></p><p>So what gives with Apache Cassandra and DataStax, the company that for most of its history was most closely associated with the database and open source project? It boils down to the nature of the open source project. Unlike MongoDB, which controls the underlying open source project and <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/community/licensing\">licenses the database</a> under <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html\">AGPL 3</a> license (which requires developers to contribute back to the community), Cassandra is an official Apache Foundation project that is governed by the Apache license.</p><p>So DataStax does not own or control Cassandra, and a couple years ago, <a href=\"https://sdtimes.com/apache/jonathan-ellis-steps-cassandra-project/\">stepped back</a> from <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/2016/08/a-look-back-a-look-forward\">leadership</a> of the project. DataStax still contributes and maintains presence on the Cassandra project, but the bulk of its energies are in building the enterprise platform features around it. In essence, DataStax is becoming more of a classic \"open core\" software company, a strategy that is not all that different from <a href=\"http://cloudera.com/\">Cloudera's</a> on Hadoop.</p><p>With Cassandra at 10, DataStax still embraces the platform but views it as the starting point for additional features. It is reaching out to accommodate analytics and search with Spark connectivity and new search functions that have been added to its CQL query language. Then there is the addition of graph, which came from the 2015 acquisition of Aurelius that brought the leaders of the <a href=\"https://tinkerpop.apache.org/\">Apache TinkerPop</a> project to DataStax. While DataStax is still working to fully integrate graph into its implementation of Cassandra, in the <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise-6\">DSE 6.0</a> release, you can load graph and Cassandra tables at the same time onto your cluster. And the company is now meeting cloud frenemies like Amazon head-on by rolling out the DataStax Managed Cloud service on AWS and Azure</p><p>There's a reason that we've been seeing all these tenth anniversaries in the big data space over the past few years. That's because in the first decade of the 2000s, a backlash formed against the post-Y2K consensus that we were at the end of times where n-tier was the de facto standard application architecture; .NET and Java were the predominant application development stacks; and relational databases were entrenched as the enterprise standard. Notably, it was the experiences of Internet companies like Amazon and Google who subsequently overthrew the enterprise IT order whose experiences with the limitations of the post-2000 technology stack gave rise to the innovations that are now hitting middle age.</p><p>A decade in, Cassandra is no longer the new kid on the block. But the database has become one of the fixtures of modern operational systems, and the company most associated with it is using it as a jumping off point to a broader platform.</p>",

I have already mentioned ParGCCardsPerStrideChunk\nin article related to patch. This time, I decided study effect of this option more closely.</div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br />\nParallel copy collector (ParNew), responsible for young\ncollection in CMS, use ParGCCardsPerStrideChunk\n value to control granularity of tasks\ndistributed between worker threads. Old space is broken into strides of equal\nsize and each worker responsible for processing (find dirty pages, find old to\nyoung references, copy young objects etc) a subset of strides. Time to process each\nstride may vary greatly, so workers may steal work from each other. For that\nreason number of strides should be greater than number of workers. </div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br />\nBy default ParGCCardsPerStrideChunk\n=256 (card is 512 bytes, so it would be 128KiB of heap space per stride) which means that 28GiB heap\nwould be broken into 224 thousands of strides. Provided that number of parallel\nGC threads is usually 4 orders of magnitude less, this is probably too many.</div>\n<h4>\nSynthetic benchmark</h4>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\">\nFirst, I have run GC benchmark from <a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/2011/07/openjdk-patch-cutting-down-gc-pause.html\">previous\narticle</a> using 2k, 4k and 8K for this option.

I decided to continue my experiments with\nstride size 4k as it shows most consistent improvement across whole range of\nheap sizes.</div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br />\nBenchmark above is synthetic and very simple.

        "content": "<div class=\"DXDvBlgCtaAD_wrp1\"><p>Learn more about Apache Cassandra and data modeling</p></div><p>Picking the right <a href=\"http://planetcassandra.org/getting-started-with-time-series-data-modeling/\">data model</a> is the hardest part of using Cassandra.  If you have a relational background, CQL will look familiar, but the way you use it can be very different.  The goal of this post is to explain the basic rules you should keep in mind when designing your schema for Cassandra.  If you follow these rules, you'll get pretty good performance out of the box.  Better yet, your performance should scale linearly as you add nodes to the cluster.</p><h2>Non-Goals</h2><p>Developers coming from a relational background usually carry over rules about relational modeling and try to apply them to Cassandra.  To avoid wasting time on rules that don't really matter with Cassandra, I want to point out some <em>non</em>-goals:</p><h3>Minimize the Number of Writes</h3><p>Writes in Cassandra aren't free, but they're awfully cheap.  Cassandra is optimized for high write throughput, and almost all writes are equally efficient <a href=\"#footnote\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.  If you can perform extra writes to improve the efficiency of your read queries, it's almost always a good tradeoff.  Reads tend to be more expensive and are much more difficult to tune.</p><h3>Minimize Data Duplication</h3><p>Denormalization and duplication of data is a fact of life with Cassandra.  Don't be afraid of it.  Disk space is generally the cheapest resource (compared to CPU, memory, disk IOPs, or network), and Cassandra is architected around that fact.  In order to get the most efficient reads, you often need to duplicate data.</p><p>Besides, Cassandra doesn't have <code>JOIN</code>s, and you don't really want to use those in a distributed fashion.</p><h2>Basic Goals</h2><p>These are the two high-level goals for your data model:</p><ol><li>Spread data evenly around the cluster</li>\n<li>Minimize the number of partitions read</li>\n</ol><p>There are other, lesser goals to keep in mind, but these are the most important. For the most part, I will focus on the basics of achieving these two goals.  There are other fancy tricks you can use, but you should know how to evaluate them, first.</p><h3>Rule 1: Spread Data Evenly Around the Cluster</h3><p>You want every node in the cluster to have roughly the same amount of data. Cassandra makes this easy, but it's not a given.  Rows are spread around the cluster based on a hash of the <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/documentation/cassandra/2.1/cassandra/architecture/architectureDataDistributeHashing_c.html\"><em>partition key</em></a>, which is the first element of the <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/documentation/cql/3.0/cql/ddl/ddl_compound_keys_c.html\"><code>PRIMARY KEY</code></a>.  So, the key to spreading data evenly is this: <b>pick a good primary key</b>.  I'll explain how to do this in a bit.</p><h3>Rule 2: Minimize the Number of Partitions Read</h3><p>Partitions are groups of rows that share the same partition key.  When you issue a read query, you want to read rows from as few partitions as possible.</p><p>Why is this important?  Each partition may reside on a different node. The coordinator will generally need to issue separate commands to separate nodes for each partition you request.  This adds a lot of overhead and increases the variation in latency.  Furthermore, even on a single node, it's more expensive to read from multiple partitions than from a single one due to the way rows are stored.</p><h3>Conflicting Rules?</h3><p>If it's good to minimize the number of partitions that you read from, why not put everything in a single big partition?  You would end up violating Rule #1, which is to spread data evenly around the cluster.</p><p>The point is, these two goals often conflict, so you'll need to try to balance them.</p><h2>Model Around Your Queries</h2><p>The way to minimize partition reads is to model your data to fit your queries. Don't model around relations.  Don't model around objects.  Model around your queries.  Here's how you do that:</p><h3>Step 1: Determine What Queries to Support</h3><p>Try to determine <em>exactly</em> what queries you need to support.  This can include a lot of considerations that you may not think of at first.  For example, you may need to think about:</p><ul><li>Grouping by an attribute</li>\n<li>Ordering by an attribute</li>\n<li>Filtering based on some set of conditions</li>\n<li>Enforcing uniqueness in the result set</li>\n<li>etc ...</li>\n</ul><p>Changes to just one of these query requirements will frequently warrant a data model change for maximum efficiency.</p><h3>Step 2: Try to create a table where you can satisfy your query by reading (roughly) one partition</h3><p>In practice, this generally means you will use roughly one table per query pattern. If you need to support multiple query patterns, you usually need more than one table.</p><p>To put this another way, each table should pre-build the \"answer\" to a high-level query that you need to support.  If you need different types of answers, you usually need different tables.  This is how you optimize for reads.</p><p>Remember, data duplication is okay.  Many of your tables may repeat the same data.</p><h2>Applying the Rules: Examples</h2><p>To show some examples of a good throught process, I will walk you through the design of a data model for some simple problems.</p><h3>Example 1: User Lookup</h3><p>The high-level requirement is \"we have users and want to look them up\".  Let's go through the steps:</p><p><b>Step 1</b>: <em>Determine what specific queries to support</em><br />Let's say we want to either be able to look up a user by their username or their email.  With either lookup method, we should get the full set of user details.</p><p><b>Step 2</b>: <em>Try to create a table where you can satisfy your query by reading (roughly) one partition</em><br />Since we want to get the full details for the user with either lookup method, it's best to use two tables:</p><pre class=\"brush: sql; gutter: true; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\nCREATE TABLE users_by_username (&#13;\n    username text PRIMARY KEY,&#13;\n    email text,&#13;\n    age int&#13;\n)&#13;\n&#13;\nCREATE TABLE users_by_email (&#13;\n    email text PRIMARY KEY,&#13;\n    username text,&#13;\n    age int&#13;\n)&#13;\n</pre><p>Now, let's check the two rules for this model:</p><p><b>Spreads data evenly?</b> Each user gets their own partition, so yes.<br /><b>Minimal partitions read?</b> We only have to read one partition, so yes.</p><p>Now, let's suppose we tried to optimize for the <em>non</em>-goals, and came up with this data model instead:</p><pre class=\"brush: sql; gutter: true; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\nCREATE TABLE users (&#13;\n    id uuid PRIMARY KEY,&#13;\n    username text,&#13;\n    email text,&#13;\n    age int&#13;\n)&#13;\n&#13;\nCREATE TABLE users_by_username (&#13;\n    username text PRIMARY KEY,&#13;\n    id uuid&#13;\n)&#13;\n&#13;\nCREATE TABLE users_by_email (&#13;\n    email text PRIMARY KEY,&#13;\n    id uuid&#13;\n)&#13;\n</pre><p>This data model also spreads data evenly, but there's a downside: we now have to read two partitions, one from <code>users_by_username</code> (or <code>users_by_email</code>) and then one from <code>users</code>.  So reads are roughly twice as expensive.</p><h3>Example 2: User Groups</h3><p>Now the high-level requirement has changed.  Users are in groups, and we want to get all users in a group.</p><p><b>Step 1</b>: <em>Determine what specific queries to support</em><br />We want to get the full user info for every user in a particular group.  Order of users does not matter.</p><p><b>Step 2</b>: <em>Try to create a table where you can satisfy your query by reading (roughly) one partition</em><br />How do we fit a group into a partition?  We can use a compound <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> for this:</p><pre class=\"brush: sql; gutter: true; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\nCREATE TABLE groups (&#13;\n    groupname text,&#13;\n    username text,&#13;\n    email text,&#13;\n    age int,&#13;\n    PRIMARY KEY (groupname, username)&#13;\n)&#13;\n</pre><p>Note that the <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> has two components: <code>groupname</code>, which is the partitioning key, and <code>username</code>, which is called the clustering key.  This will give us one partition per <code>groupname</code>.  Within a particular partition (group), rows will be ordered by <code>username</code>.  Fetching a group is as simple as doing the following:</p><pre class=\"brush: sql; gutter: true; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\nSELECT * FROM groups WHERE groupname = ?&#13;\n</pre><p>This satisfies the goal of minimizing the number of partitions that are read, because we only need to read one partition.  However, it doesn't do so well with the first goal of evenly spreading data around the cluster.  If we have thousands or millions of small groups with hundreds of users each, we'll get a pretty even spread.  But if there's one group with millions of users in it, the entire burden will be shouldered by one node (or one set of replicas).</p><p>If we want to spread the load more evenly, there are a few strategies we can use. The basic technique is to add another column to the PRIMARY KEY to form a compound partition key.  Here's one example:</p><pre class=\"brush: sql; gutter: true; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\nCREATE TABLE groups (&#13;\n    groupname text,&#13;\n    username text,&#13;\n    email text,&#13;\n    age int,&#13;\n    hash_prefix int,&#13;\n    PRIMARY KEY ((groupname, hash_prefix), username)&#13;\n)&#13;\n</pre><p>The new column, <code>hash_prefix</code>, holds a prefix of a hash of the username.  For example, it could be the first byte of the hash modulo four. Together with <code>groupname</code>, these two columns form the compound partition key.  Instead of a group residing on one partition, it's now spread across four partitions.  Our data is more evenly spread out, but we now have to read four times as many partitions.  This is an example of the two goals conflicting.  You need to find a good balance for your particular use case.  If you do a lot of reads and groups don't get too large, maybe changing the modulo value from four to two would be a good choice.  On the other hand, if you do very few reads, but any given group can grow very large, changing from four to ten would be a better choice.</p><p>There are other ways to split up a partition, which I will cover in the next example.</p><p>Before we move on, let me point out something else about this data model: we're duplicating user info potentially many times, once for each group. You might be tempted to try a data model like this to reduce duplication:</p><pre class=\"brush: sql; gutter: true; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\nCREATE TABLE users (&#13;\n    id uuid PRIMARY KEY,&#13;\n    username text,&#13;\n    email text,&#13;\n    age int&#13;\n)&#13;\n&#13;\nCREATE TABLE groups (&#13;\n    groupname text,&#13;\n    user_id uuid,&#13;\n    PRIMARY KEY (groupname, user_id)&#13;\n)&#13;\n</pre><p>Obviously, this minimizes duplication.  But how many partitions do we need to read? If a group has 1000 users, we need to read 1001 partitions.  This is probably 100x more expensive to read than our first data model.  If reads need to be efficient at all, this isn't a good model.  On the other hand, if reads are extremely infrequent, but updates to user info (say, the username) are extremely common, this data model might actually make sense.  Make sure to take your read/update ratio into account when designing your schema.</p><h3>Example 3: User Groups by Join Date</h3><p>Suppose we continue with the previous example of groups, but need to add support for getting the X newest users in a group.</p><p>We can use a similar table to the last one:</p><pre class=\"brush: sql; gutter: true; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\nCREATE TABLE group_join_dates (&#13;\n    groupname text,&#13;\n    joined timeuuid,&#13;\n    username text,&#13;\n    email text,&#13;\n    age int,&#13;\n    PRIMARY KEY (groupname, joined)&#13;\n)&#13;\n</pre><p>Here we're using a <code>timeuuid</code> (which is like a timestamp, but avoids collisions) as the clustering column.  Within a group (partition), rows will be ordered by the time the user joined the group.  This allows us to get the newest users in a group like so:</p><pre class=\"brush: sql; gutter: true; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\nSELECT * FROM group_join_dates&#13;\n    WHERE groupname = ?&#13;\n    ORDER BY joined DESC&#13;\n    LIMIT ?&#13;\n</pre><p>This is reasonably efficient, as we're reading a slice of rows from a single partition.  However, instead of always using <code>ORDER BY joined DESC</code>, which makes the query less efficient, we can simply reverse the clustering order:</p><pre class=\"brush: sql; gutter: true; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\nCREATE TABLE group_join_dates (&#13;\n    groupname text,&#13;\n    joined timeuuid,&#13;\n    username text,&#13;\n    email text,&#13;\n    age int,&#13;\n    PRIMARY KEY (groupname, joined)&#13;\n) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (joined DESC)&#13;\n</pre><p>Now we can use the slightly more efficient query:</p><pre class=\"brush: sql; gutter: true; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\nSELECT * FROM group_join_dates&#13;\n    WHERE groupname = ?&#13;\n    LIMIT ?&#13;\n</pre><p>As with the previous example, we could have problems with data being spread evenly around the cluster if any groups get too large.  In that example, we split partitions somewhat randomly, but in this case, we can utilize our knowledge about the query patterns to split partitions a different way: by a time range.</p><p>For example, we might split partitions by date:</p><pre class=\"brush: sql; gutter: true; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\nCREATE TABLE group_join_dates (&#13;\n    groupname text,&#13;\n    joined timeuuid,&#13;\n    join_date text,&#13;\n    username text,&#13;\n    email text,&#13;\n    age int,&#13;\n    PRIMARY KEY ((groupname, join_date), joined)&#13;\n) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (joined DESC)&#13;\n</pre><p>We're using a compound partition key again, but this time we're using the join date.  Each day, a new partition will start.  When querying the X newest users, we will first query today's partition, then yesterday's, and so on, until we have X users.  We may have to read multiple partitions before the limit is met.</p><p>To minimize the number of partitions you need to query, try to select a time range for splitting partitions that will typically let you query only one or two partitions.  For example, if we usually need the ten newest users, and groups usually acquire three users per day, we should split by four-day ranges instead of a single day <a href=\"#footnote\"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>The basic rules of data modeling covered here apply to all (currently) existing versions of Cassandra, and are very likely to apply to all future versions.  Other lesser data modeling problems, such as <a href=\"https://medium.com/@foundev/domain-modeling-around-deletes-1cc9b6da0d24\">dealing with tombstones</a>, may also need to be considered, but these problems are more likely to change (or be mitigated) by future versions of Cassandra.</p><p>Besides the basic strategies covered here, some of Cassandra's fancier features, like <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/cql3_collections\">collections</a>, <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/cql-in-2-1\">user-defined types</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/documentation/cql/3.1/cql/cql_reference/refStaticCol.html\">static columns</a>, can also be used to reduce the number of partitions that you need to read to satisfy a query.  Don't forget to consider these options when designing your schema.</p><p>Hopefully I've given you some useful fundamental tools for evaluating different schema designs.

        "content": "<h2>Init</h2><p>As mentioned in my <a href=\"http://tobert.github.io/post/2014-07-14-portacluster-system-imaging.html\">portacluster system imaging</a> post,\nI am performing this install on 1 admin node (node0) and 6 worker nodes (node[1-6]) running 64-bit Arch Linux.\nMost of what I describe in this post should work on other Linux variants with minor adjustments.</p><h2>Overview</h2><p>When assembling an analytics stack, there are usually myriad choices to make. For this build, I decided to\nbuild the smallest stack possible that lets me run Spark queries on Cassandra data. As configured it is\nnot highly available since the Spark master is standalone. (note: Datastax Enterprise Spark's master has\nHA based on Cassandra). It's a decent tradeoff for portacluster, since\nI can run the master on the admin node which doesn't get rebooted/reimaged constantly. I'm also going to\nskip HDFS or some kind of HDFS replacement for now. Options I plan to look at later are GlusterFS's HDFS\nadapter and <a href=\"http://pithos.io\">Pithos</a> as an S3 adapter. In the end, the stack is simply Cassandra and\nSpark with the <a href=\"https://github.com/datastax/spark-cassandra-connector\">spark-cassandra-connector</a>.</p><h2>Responsible Configuration</h2><p>For this post I've used my <a href=\"https://github.com/tobert/perl-ssh-tools\">perl-ssh-tools</a> suite. The intent\nis to show what needs to be done and one way to do it. For production deployments, I recommend using\nyour favorite configuration management tool.</p><p>perl-ssh-tools uses a configuration similar to dsh, which uses simple files with one\nhost per line. I use two lists below. Most commands run on the fleet of workers. Because\ncl-run.pl provides more than ssh commands, it's also used to run commands on node0 using\nits --incl flag e.g. <code>cl-run.pl --list all --incl node0</code>.</p><pre>cat .dsh/machines.workers\nnode1\nnode2\nnode3\nnode4\nnode5\nnode6\n</pre><p><code>machines.all</code> is the same with node0 added.</p><h2>Install Cassandra</h2><p>My first pass at this section involved setting up a package repo, but since I don't have time to package\nSpark properly right now, I'm going to use the tarball distros of Cassandra and Spark to keep it simple.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/joschi\">joschi</a> maintains a package on the <a href=\"https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cassandra/\">AUR</a>\nbut I have chosen not to use it for this install.\nI'm also using the Arch packages of OpenJDK, which isn't supported by Datastax, but works fine for hacking.\nThe JDK is pre-installed on my Arch image, it's as simple as <code>sudo pacman -S extra/jdk7-openjdk</code>.</p><p>First, I downloaded the Cassandra tarball from <a href=\"http://cassandra.apache.org/download/\">apache.org</a> to\nnode0 in /srv/public/tgz. Then on the worker nodes, it gets downloaded and expanded in /opt.</p><pre>pkg=\"apache-cassandra-2.0.9-bin.tar.gz\"\nsudo curl -o /srv/public/tgz/$pkg \\\n  http://mirrors.gigenet.com/apache/cassandra/2.0.9/apache-cassandra-2.0.9-bin.tar.gz\ncl-run.pl --list workers -c \"curl http://node0/tgz/$pkg |sudo tar -C /opt -xzf -\"\ncl-run.pl --list workers -c \"sudo ln -s /opt/apache-cassandra-2.0.9 /opt/cassandra\"\n</pre><p>To make it easier to do upgrades without regenerating the configuration, I\nrelocate the conf dir to /etc/cassandra to match what packages do. This assumes there\nis no existing /etc/cassandra.</p><pre>cl-run.pl --list workers -c \"sudo mv /opt/cassandra/conf /etc/cassandra\"\ncl-run.pl --list workers -c \"sudo ln -s /etc/cassandra /opt/cassandra/conf\"\n</pre><p>I will start Cassandra with a systemd unit, so I push that out as well. This unit\nfile runs Cassandra out of the tarball as the cassandra user with the stdout/stderr going\nto the systemd journal (view with <code>journalctl -f</code>). I also included some\nulimit settings and bump the OOM score downwards to make it less likely that the kernel\nwill kill Cassandra when out of memory. Since we're going to be running two large JVM apps\non each worker node, this unit also enables cgroups so Cassandra can be given priority\nover Spark. Finally, since the target machines have 16GB of RAM, the heap needs to be\nset to 8GB (cassandra-env.sh calculates 3995M which is way too low).</p><pre>cat &gt; cassandra.service &lt;&lt;EOF\n[Unit]\nDescription=Cassandra Tarball\nAfter=network.target\n[Service]\nUser=cassandra\nGroup=cassandra\nRuntimeDirectory=cassandra\nPIDFile=/run/cassandra/cassandra.pid\nExecStart=/opt/cassandra/bin/cassandra -f -p /run/cassandra/cassandra.pid\nStandardOutput=journal\nStandardError=journal\nOOMScoreAdjust=-500\nLimitNOFILE=infinity\nLimitMEMLOCK=infinity\nLimitNPROC=infinity\nLimitAS=infinity\nEnvironment=MAX_HEAP_SIZE=8G HEAP_NEWSIZE=1G CASSANDRA_HEAPDUMP_DIR=/srv/cassandra/log\nCPUAccounting=true\nCPUShares=1000\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\nEOF\ncl-sendfile.pl --list workers -x -l cassandra.service -r /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/cassandra.service\ncl-run.pl --list workers -c \"sudo systemctl daemon-reload\"\n</pre><p>Since all Cassandra data is being redirected to /srv/cassandra and it's going to run as the\ncassandra user, those need to be created.</p><pre>cat &gt; cassandra-user.sh &lt;&lt;EOF\nmkdir -p /srv/cassandra/{log,data,commitlogs,saved_caches}\n(grep -q '^cassandra:' /etc/group)  || groupadd -g 1234 cassandra\n(grep -q '^cassandra:' /etc/passwd) || useradd -u 1234 -c \"Apache Cassandra\" -g cassandra -s /bin/bash -d /srv/cassandra cassandra\nchown -R cassandra:cassandra /srv/cassandra\nEOF\ncl-run.pl --list workers -x -s cassandra-user.sh\n</pre><h2>Configure Cassandra</h2><p>Before starting Cassandra I want to make a few changes to the standard configurations.

The days of double writes or ETL's between separate DBMS and Search clusters are gone. I have my CQL table, I execute the following API call, and (boom) my Cassandra data is available for:</p><p>1) full text/fuzzy search</p><p>2) ad hoc Lucene secondary index powered filtering, and</p><p>3) geospatial searchHere is my API call:</p><pre>$ bin/dsetool create_core &lt;keyspace&gt;.&lt;table&gt; generateResources=true reindex=true&#13;\n</pre><p>or if you prefer curl (or are using basic auth) use the following:</p><pre>$ curl \"http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/cores?action=CREATE&amp;name=&lt;keyspace&gt;.&lt;table&gt;&amp;generateResources=true\"&#13;\n</pre><p>Rejoice! we are in inverted index, single cluster, operational simplicity bliss!</p><p>The remainder of this post will be focused on <strong>advanced tuning</strong> for DSE Search both for <strong>a)</strong> search indexing latency (the time it takes for data to be searchable after it has been inserted through cql), and <strong>b)</strong> search query latency (timings for your search requests).</p><h2 id=\"indexinglatency\">Indexing latency</h2><p>In this section I'll talk about the kinds of things we can do in order to</p><p>1) instrument and monitor DSE Search indexing and<br />2) tune indexing for lower latencies and increased performance</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: DSE Search ships with Real Time (RT) indexing which will give you faster indexing with 4.7.3, especially when it comes to the tails of your latency distribution. Here's one of our performance tests. It shows you real time vs near-real time indexing as of 4.7.0:</p><p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/6528/1116934/P10Ckn4e4cijTf0/upload.png\" alt=\"indexing chart\" width=\"488\" height=\"302\" /></p><p>Perhaps more importantly, as you get machines with more cores, you can continue to increase your indexing performance linearly:<br /><img class=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/6528/1116934/5OFvz6SgZsl68b1/Screen%20Shot%202016-03-15%20at%2011.03.22%20PM.png\" alt=\"rt vs nrt\" width=\"480\" height=\"302\" /></p><p>Be aware, however, that you should only run one RT search core per cluster since it is significantly more resource hungry than near-real time (NRT).</p><p><strong>Side note on GC</strong>: Because solr and Cassandra run on the same JVM in DSE Search and the indexing process generates a lot of java objects, running Search requires a larger JVM Heap. When running traditional <strong>CMS</strong>, we recommend a 14gb heap with about 2gb new gen. Consider the Stump's <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-8150\">CASSANDRA-8150</a> settings when running search with CMS. <strong>G1GC</strong> has been found to perform quite well with search workloads, I personally run with a 25gb heap (do not set new gen with G1, the whole point of G1 is that it sets it itself based on your workload!) and <code>gc_pause_ms</code> at about 1000 (go higher for higher throughput or lower to minimize latencies / p99's; don't go below 500). Update (thanks mc) you configure this setting in cassandra-env.sh.</p><h3 id=\"1instrumentation\">1) Instrumentation</h3><p><strong>Index Pool Stats:</strong></p><p>DSE Search parallelizes the indexing process and allocates work to a thread pool for indexing of your data.</p><p>Using JMX, you can see statistics on your indexing threadpool depth, completion, timings, and whether backpressure is active.</p><p>This is important because if your indexing queues get too deep, we risk having too much heap pressure =&gt; OOM's. Backpressure will throttle commits and eventually load shed if search can't keep up with an indexing workload. Backpressure gets triggered when the queues get too large.</p><p>The mbean is called:</p><pre>com.datastax.bdp.search.&lt;keyspace&gt;.&lt;table&gt;.IndexPool&#13;\n</pre><p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/6528/1116934/ObHJEFKOEuQnLm8/upload.png\" alt=\"Indexing queues\" width=\"523\" height=\"287\" /></p><p><strong>Commit/Update Stats:</strong></p><p>You can also see statistics on indexing performance (in microseconds) based on the particular stage of the indexing process for both <code>commit</code>s and <code>update</code>s.</p><p><strong>Commit:</strong></p><p>The stages are:</p><ul><li><code>FLUSH</code> - Comprising the time spent by flushing the async indexing queue.</li>\n<li><code>EXECUTE</code> - Comprising the time spent by actually executing the commit on the index.</li>\n</ul><p>The mbean is called:</p><ul><li><code>com.datastax.bdp.search.&lt;keyspace&gt;.&lt;table&gt;.CommitMetrics</code></li>\n</ul><p><strong>Update:</strong></p><p>The stages are:</p><ul><li><code>WRITE</code> - Comprising the time spent to convert the Solr document and write it into Cassandra (only available when indexing via the Solrj HTTP APIs). If you're using cql this will be 0.</li>\n<li><code>QUEUE</code> - Comprising the time spent by the index update task into the index pool.</li>\n<li><code>PREPARE</code>- Comprising the time spent preparing the actual index update.</li>\n<li><code>EXECUTE</code> - Comprising the time spent to actually executing the index update on Lucene.</li>\n</ul><p>The mbean is:</p><ul><li><code>`com.datastax.bdp.search.&lt;keyspace&gt;.&lt;table&gt;.UpdateMetrics` </code></li>\n</ul><p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/6528/1116934/CLrZrQNbRatrmck/upload.png\" alt=\"indexing stats\" width=\"524\" height=\"308\" /></p><p>Here, the average latency for the QUEUE stage of the <code>update</code> is 767 micros. See our docs for more details on the <a href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/datastax_enterprise/5.0/datastax_enterprise/srch/metricsMBeans.html\">metrics mbeans</a> and their stages.</p><h3 id=\"2tuning\">2) Tuning</h3><p>Almost everything in c* and DSE is configurable. Here's the key levers to get you better search indexing performance. Based on what you see in your instrumentation you can tune accordingly.</p><p>The main lever is <code>soft autocommit</code>, that's the minimum amount of time that will go by before queries are available for search. With RT we can set it to 250 ms or even as low as 100ms--given the right hardware. Tune this based on your SLA's.</p><p>The next most important lever is concurrency per core (or <code>max_solr_concurrency_per_core</code>). You can usually set this to number of CPU cores available to maximize indexing throughput.</p><p>Backpressure threshold will become more important as your load increases. Larger boxes can handle higher bp thresholds.</p><p>Don't forget to set up the ramBuffer to 2gb per the docs when you turn on RT indexing.</p><h2 id=\"querylatency\">Query Latency</h2><p>Now, I'll go over how we can monitor query performance in DSE Search, identify issues, and some of the tips / tricks we can use to improve search query performance. I will cover how to:</p><p>1) instrument and monitor DSE Search indexing and<br />2) tune indexing for lower latencies and increased performance.</p><p>Simliar to how search indexing performance scales with CPU's, search query performance scales with RAM. Keeping your search indexes in OS page cache is the biggest thing you can do to minimize latencies; so scale deliberately!</p><h3>1) Instrumentation</h3><p>There are multiple tools available for monitoring search performance.</p><h4 id=\"opscenter\">OpsCenter:</h4><p>OpsCenter supports a few search metrics that can be configured per node, datacenter, and solr core:</p><p>1) search latencies<br />2) search requests<br />3) index size<br />4) search timeouts<br />5) search errors</p><p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/6528/1116934/uoq1hLRQ58AZBhn/Screen%20Shot%202016-03-15%20at%2011.47.12%20PM.png\" alt=\"opscenter\" width=\"368\" height=\"226\" /></p><h4 id=\"metricsmbeans\">Metrics mbeans:</h4><p>In the same way that indexing has performance metrics, DSE Search <a href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/datastax_enterprise/4.0/datastax_enterprise/srch/srchQryMbean.html\">query performance metrics</a> are available through JMX and can be useful for troubleshooting perofrmance issues. We can use the <code>query.name</code> parameter in your DSE Search queries to capture metrics for specifically tagged queries.</p><p><strong>Query:</strong></p><p>The stages of <code>query</code> are:</p><ul><li><code>COORDINATE</code> - Comprises the total amount of time spent by the coordinator node to distribute the query and gather/process results from shards. This value is computed only on query coordinator nodes.</li>\n<li><code>EXECUTE</code> - Comprises the time spent by a single shard to execute the actual index query. This value is computed on the local node executing the shard query.</li>\n<li><code>RETRIEVE</code> - Comprises the time spent by a single shard to retrieve the actual data from Cassandra. This value will be computed on the local node hosting the requested data.</li>\n</ul><p>The mbean is:</p><ul><li><code>com.datastax.bdp.search.&lt;keyspace&gt;.&lt;table&gt;.QueryMetrics </code></li>\n</ul><h4 id=\"querytracing\">Query Tracing:</h4><p>When using <code>solr_query</code> via cql, query tracing can provide useful information as to where a particular query spent time in the cluster.</p><p>Query tracing is available in cqlsh <code>tracing on</code>, in DevCenter (in the tab at the bottom of the screen), and via probabilistic tracing which is configurable via <a href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.1/cassandra/tools/toolsSetTraceProbability.html\">nodetool</a>.</p><p>When users complain about a slow query and you need to find out what it is, the DSE Search slow query log is a good starting point.</p><pre>dsetool perf solrslowlog enable&#13;\n</pre><p>Stores to a table in cassandra in the <code>dse_perf.solr_slow_sub_query_log</code> table</p><h3>2) Tuning</h3><p>Now let's focus on some tips for how you can improve search query performance.</p><h3 id=\"indexsize\">Index size</h3><p>Index size is so important that, I wrote <a href=\"http://www.sestevez.com/solr-space-saving-profile/\">a separate post</a> just on that subject.</p><h4 id=\"qvsfq\">Q vs. FQ</h4><p>In order to take advantage of the solr filter cache, build your queries using fq not q. The filter cache is the only solr cache that persists across commits so don't spend time or valuable RAM trying to leverage the other caches.</p><h4 id=\"solrqueryrouting\">Solr query routing</h4><p>Partition routing is a great multi-tennancy feature in DSE Search that lets you limit the amount of fan out that a search query will take under the hood. Essentially, you're able to specify a Cassandra partition that you are interested in limiting your search to. This will limit the number of nodes that DSE Search requires to fullfil your request.</p><h4 id=\"usedocvaluesforfacetingandsorting\">Use docvalues for Faceting and Sorting.</h4><p>To get improved performance and to avoid OOMs from the field cache, always remember to turn on docvalues on fields that you will be sorting and faceting over. This may become mandatory in DSE at some point so plan ahead.</p><h3 id=\"otherdsedifferentiators\">Other DSE Differentiators</h3><p>If you're comparing DSE Search against other search offerings / technologies, the following two differentiators are unique to DSE Search.</p><h4 id=\"faulttolerantdistributedqueries\">Fault tolerant distributed queries</h4><p>If a node dies during a query, we retry the query on another node.</p><h4 id=\"nodehealth\">Node health</h4><p>Node health and shard router behavior.<br />DSE Search monitors node health and makes distributed query routing decisions based on the following:</p><p>1) Uptime: a node that just started may well be lacking the most up-to-date data (to be repaired via HH or AE).<br />2) Number of dropped mutations.<br />3) Number of hints the node is a target for.<br />4) \"failed reindex\" status.</p><p>All you need to take advantage of this is be on a modern DSE version.</p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/\">DataStax</a> has many ways for you to advance in your career and knowledge. \n</p><p>You can take <a href=\"https://academy.datastax.com/user/register?destination=home&amp;utm_campaign=DevBlog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=devblog&amp;utm_term=DevBlogPosts_CTA1_DSA_register\" target=\"_self\" title=\"academy.datastax.com\">free classes</a>, <a href=\"https://academy.datastax.com/certifications?utm_campaign=DevBlog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=devblog&amp;utm_term=DevBlogPosts_CTA1_DSA_certifications\" target=\"_self\" title=\"academy.datastax.com/certifications\">get certified</a>, or read <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dbas-guide-to-nosql\" target=\"_self\" title=\"dbas-guide-to-nosql\">one of our many white papers</a>.\n</p><p><a href=\"https://academy.datastax.com/user/register?destination=home&amp;utm_campaign=DevBlog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=devblog&amp;utm_term=DevBlogPosts_CTA1_DSA_register\" target=\"_self\" class=\"dxAllButtons_v3Rad2_whiteNGrayOL\" title=\"academy.datastax.com\">register for classes</a>\n</p><p><a href=\"https://academy.datastax.com/certifications?utm_campaign=DevBlog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=devblog&amp;utm_term=DevBlogPosts_CTA1_DSA_certifications\" target=\"_self\" class=\"dxAllButtons_v3Rad2_whiteNGrayOL\" title=\"academy.datastax.com/certifications\">get certified</a>\n</p><p><a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/dbas-guide-to-nosql?utm_campaign=DevBlog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=devblog&amp;utm_term=DevBlogPosts_CTA1_dbasguidetonosql\" target=\"_self\" class=\"dxAllButtons_v3Rad2_whiteNGrayOL\" title=\"dbas-guide-to-nosql\">DBA's Guide to NoSQL</a>\n</p><br class=\"clear\" /><div id=\"mto_newsletter_121316_Css\"><p>Subscribe for newsletter:</p><br /></div>",

Thank you for your understanding and continued help throughout the project's life.</p>\n<p>Deep is a thin integration layer between Apache Spark and several NoSQL datastores.\nWe actually support Apache Cassandra, MongoDB, Elastic Search, Aerospike, HDFS, S3 and any database accessible through JDBC, but in the near future we will add support for sever other datastores.</p>\n<ul><li>JIRA: <a href=\"https://deep-spark.atlassian.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://deep-spark.atlassian.net</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to compile the deep-jdbc module is necessary to add the Oracle ojdbc driver into your local repository. You can download it from the URL: <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/default-2280470.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/default-2280470.html</a>. When you are on the web you must click in \"Accept License Agreement\" and later downlad ojdbc7.jar library. You need a free oracle account to download the official driver.</p>\n<p>To install the ojdbc driver in your local repository you must execute the command below:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>mvn install:install-file -Dfile= -DgroupId=com.oracle -DartifactId=ojdbc7  -Dversion=12.1.0.2 -Dpackaging=jar</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After that you can compile Deep executing the following steps:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>cd deep-parent</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>mvn clean install</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you want to create a Deep distribution you must execute the following steps:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>cd deep-scripts</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>make-distribution-deep.sh</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>During the creation you'll see the following question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What tag want to use for Aerospike native repository?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You must type 0.7.0 and press enter.</p>\n<p>The integration is <em>not</em> based on the Cassandra's Hadoop interface.</p>\n<p>Deep comes with an user friendly API that lets developers create Spark RDDs mapped to Cassandra column families.\nWe provide two different interfaces:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p>The first one will let developers map Cassandra tables to plain old java objects (POJOs), just like if you were using any other ORM. We call this API the 'entity objects' API.\nThis abstraction is quite handy, it will let you work on RDD (under the hood Deep will transparently map Cassandra's columns to entity properties).\nYour domain entities must be correctly annotated using Deep annotations (take a look at deep-core example entities in package com.stratio.deep.core.entity).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The second one is a more generic 'cell' API, that will let developerss work on RDD&lt;com.stratio.deep.entity.Cells&gt; where a 'Cells' object is a collection of com.stratio.deep.entity.Cell objects.\nColumn metadata is automatically fetched from the data store. This interface is a little bit more cumbersome to work with (see the example below),\nbut has the advantage that it doesn't require the definition of additional entity classes.\nExample: you have a table called 'users' and you decide to use the 'Cells' interface. Once you get an instance 'c' of the Cells object,\nto get the value of column 'address' you can issue a c.getCellByName(\"address\").getCellValue().\nPlease, refer to the Deep API documentation to know more about the Cells and Cell objects.</p>\n</li>\n</ul><p>We encourage you to read the more comprehensive documentation hosted on the <a href=\"http://www.openstratio.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Openstratio website</a>.</p>\n<p>Deep comes with an example sub project called 'deep-examples' containing a set of working examples, both in Java and Scala.\nPlease, refer to the deep-example project README for further information on how to setup a working environment.</p>\n<p>Spark-MongoDB connector is based on Hadoop-mongoDB.</p>\n<p>Support for MongoDB has been added in version 0.3.0.</p>\n<p>We provide two different interfaces:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p>ORM API, you just have to annotate your POJOs with Deep annotations and magic will begin, you will be able to connect MongoDB with Spark using your own model entities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Generic cell API, you do not need to specify the collection's schema or add anything to your POJOs, each document will be transform to an object \"Cells\".</p>\n</li>\n</ul><p>We added a few working examples for MongoDB in deep-examples subproject, take a look at:</p>\n<p>Entities:</p>\n<ul><li>com.stratio.deep.examples.java.ReadingEntityFromMongoDB</li>\n<li>com.stratio.deep.examples.java.WritingEntityToMongoDB</li>\n<li>com.stratio.deep.examples.java.GroupingEntityWithMongoDB</li>\n</ul><p>Cells:</p>\n<ul><li>com.stratio.deep.examples.java.ReadingCellFromMongoDB</li>\n<li>com.stratio.deep.examples.java.WritingCellToMongoDB</li>\n<li>com.stratio.deep.examples.java.GroupingCellWithMongoDB</li>\n</ul><p>You can check out our first steps guide here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Stratio/deep-spark/blob/master/doc/src/site/sphinx/t20-first-steps-deep-mongodb.rst\">First steps with Deep-MongoDB</a></p>\n<p>We are working on further improvements!</p>\n<p>Support for ElasticSearch has been added in version 0.5.0.</p>\n<p>Support for Aerospike has been added in version 0.6.0.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<p>Entities:</p>\n<ul><li>com.stratio.deep.examples.java.ReadingEntityFromAerospike</li>\n<li>com.stratio.deep.examples.java.WritingEntityToAerospike</li>\n<li>com.stratio.deep.examples.java.GroupingEntityWithAerospike</li>\n</ul><p>Cells:</p>\n<ul><li>com.stratio.deep.examples.java.ReadingCellFromAerospike</li>\n<li>com.stratio.deep.examples.java.WritingCellToAerospike</li>\n<li>com.stratio.deep.examples.java.GroupingCellWithAerospike</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Support for JDBC has been added in version 0.7.0.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<p>Entities:</p>\n<ul><li>package com.stratio.deep.examples.java.ReadingEntityWithJdbc</li>\n<li>package com.stratio.deep.examples.java.WritingEntityWithJdbc</li>\n</ul><p>Cells:</p>\n<ul><li>package com.stratio.deep.examples.java.ReadingCellWithJdbc</li>\n<li>package com.stratio.deep.examples.java.WritingCellWithJdbc</li>\n</ul>\n<ul><li>Cassandra, we tested versions from 1.2.8 up to 2.0.11 (for Spark &lt;=&gt; Cassandra integration).</li>\n<li>MongoDB, we tested the integration with MongoDB versions 2.2, 2.4 y 2.6 using Standalone, Replica Set and Sharded Cluster (for Spark &lt;=&gt; MongoDB integration).</li>\n<li>ElasticSearch, 1.3.0+</li>\n<li>Aerospike, 3.3.0+</li>\n<li>Spark 1.1.1</li>\n<li>Apache Maven &gt;= 3.0.4</li>\n<li>Java 1.7</li>\n<li>Scala 2.10.3</li>\n</ul>\n<ul><li>\n<p>Clone the project</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To configure a development environment in Eclipse: import as Maven project.

Enter deep-parent subproject and perform: mvn clean install (add -DskipTests to skip tests)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Put Deep to work on a working cassandra + spark cluster. You have several options:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p>Download a pre-configured Stratio platform VM <a href=\"http://www.stratio.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stratio's BigData platform (SDS)</a>.\nThis VM will work on both Virtualbox and VMWare, and comes with a fully configured distribution that also includes Stratio Deep. We also distribute the VM with several preloaded datasets in Cassandra. This distribution will include Stratio's customized Cassandra distribution containing our powerful <a href=\"https://github.com/Stratio/stratio-cassandra\">open-source lucene-based secondary indexes</a>, see Stratio documentation for further information.\nOnce your VM is up and running you can test Deep using the shell. Enter /opt/sds and run bin/stratio-deep-shell.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Install a new cluster using the Stratio installer. Please refer to Stratio's website to download the installer and its documentation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You already have a working Cassandra server on your development machine: you need a spark+deep bundle, we suggest to create one by running:</p>\n<p><code>cd deep-scripts</code></p>\n<p><code>./make-distribution-deep.sh</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul><p>this will build a Spark distribution package with StratioDeep and Cassandra's jars included (depending on your machine this script could take a while, since it will compile Spark from sources).\nThe package will be called <code>spark-deep-distribution-X.Y.Z.tgz</code>, untar it to a folder of your choice, enter that folder and issue a <code>./stratio-deep-shell</code>, this will start an interactive shell where you can test StratioDeep (you may have noticed this is will start a development cluster started with MASTER=\"local\").</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p>You already have a working installation os Cassandra and Spark on your development machine: this is the most difficult way to start testing Deep, but you know what you're doing you will have to</p>\n<ol><li>copy the Stratio Deep jars to Spark's 'jars' folder (<code>$SPARK_HOME/jars</code>).</li>\n<li>copy Cassandra's jars to Spark's 'jar' folder.</li>\n<li>copy Datastax Java Driver jar (v 2.0.x) to Spark's 'jar' folder.</li>\n<li>start spark shell and import the following:</li>\n</ol><p><code>import com.stratio.deep.commons.annotations._</code></p>\n<p><code>import com.stratio.deep.commons.config._</code></p>\n<p><code>import com.stratio.deep.commons.entity._</code></p>\n<p><code>import com.stratio.deep.core.context._</code></p>\n<p><code>import com.stratio.deep.cassandra.config._</code></p>\n<p><code>import com.stratio.deep.cassandra.extractor._</code></p>\n<p><code>import com.stratio.deep.mongodb.config._</code></p>\n<p><code>import com.stratio.deep.mongodb.extractor._</code></p>\n<p><code>import com.stratio.deep.es.config._</code></p>\n<p><code>import com.stratio.deep.es.extractor._</code></p>\n<p><code>import com.stratio.deep.aerospike.config._</code></p>\n<p><code>import com.stratio.deep.aerospike.extractor._</code></p>\n<p><code>import org.apache.spark.rdd._</code></p>\n<p><code>import org.apache.spark.SparkContext._</code></p>\n<p><code>import org.apache.spark.sql.api.java.JavaSQLContext</code></p>\n<p><code>import org.apache.spark.sql.api.java.JavaSchemaRDD</code></p>\n<p><code>import org.apache.spark.sql.api.java.Row</code></p>\n<p><code>import scala.collection.JavaConversions._</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul><p>Once you have a working development environment you can finally start testing Deep. This are the basic steps you will always have to perform in order to use Deep:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Build an instance of a configuration object</strong>: this will let you tell Deep the Cassandra endpoint, the keyspace, the table you want to access and much more.\nIt will also let you specify which interface to use (the domain entity or the generic interface).\nWe have a factory that will help you create a configuration object using a fluent API. Creating a configuration object is an expensive operation.\nPlease take the time to read the java and scala examples provided in 'deep-examples' subproject and to read the comprehensive documentation at <a href=\"https://github.com/Stratio/deep-spark/blob/release/0.6/doc/t10-first-steps-deep-cassandra.md\">OpenStratio website</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Create an RDD</strong>: using the DeepSparkContext helper methods and providing the configuration object you've just instantiated.</li>\n<li><strong>Perform some computation over this RDD(s)</strong>: this is up to you, we only help you fetching the data efficiently from Cassandra, you can use the powerful <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.1.1/api/java/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spark API</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>(optional) write the computation results out to Cassandra</strong>: we provide a way to efficiently save the result of your computation to Cassandra.\nIn order to do that you must have another configuration object where you specify the output keyspace/column family.

To port your code to the new version you should take into account a few changes we made.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"user-content-new-project-structure\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#new-project-structure\"></a>New Project Structure</h2>\n<p>From version 0.4.x, Deep supports multiple datastores, in your project you should import only the maven dependency you will use: deep-cassandra, deep-mongodb, deep-elasticsearch or deep-aerospike.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"user-content-changes-to-comstratiodeepentitycells\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#changes-to-comstratiodeepentitycells\"></a>Changes to 'com.stratio.deep.entity.Cells'</h2>\n<ul><li>Until version 0.4.x the 'Cells' was implicitly associated to a record coming from a specific table. When performing a join in Spark, 'Cell' objects coming from different tables are mixed into an single 'Cells' object.\nDeep now keeps track of the original table a Cell object comes from, changing the internal structure of 'Cells', where each 'Cell' is associated to its 'table'.\n<ol><li>If you are a user of 'Cells' objects returned from Deep, nothing changes for you. The 'Cells' API keeps working as usual.</li>\n<li>If you manually create 'Cells' objects you can keep using the original API, in this case each Cell you add to your Cells object is automatically associated to a default table name.</li>\n<li>You can specify the default table name, or let Deep chose an internal default table name for you.</li>\n<li>We added a new constructor to 'Cells' accepting the default table name. This way the 'old' API will always manipulate 'Cell' objects associated to the specified default table.</li>\n<li>For each method manipulating the content of a 'Cells' object, we added a new method that also accepts the table name: if you call the method\t whose signature does <em>not</em> have the table name, the table action is performed over the Cell associated to the default table, otherwise the action is performed over the 'Cell'(s) associated to the specified table.</li>\n<li>size() y isEmpty() will compute their results taking into account all the 'Cell' objects contained.</li>\n<li>size(String tableName) and isEmpty(tableName) compute their result taking into account only the 'Cell' objects associated to the specified table.</li>\n<li>Obviously, when dealing with Cells objects, Deep always associates a Cell to the correct table name.</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ul><p>Examples:</p>\n<pre>Cells cells1 = new Cells(); // instantiate a Cells object whose default table name is generated internally.\nCells cells2 = new Cells(\"my_default_table\"); // creates a new Cells object whose default table name is specified by the user\ncells2.add(new Cell(...)); // adds to the 'cells2' object a new Cell object associated to the default table\ncells2.add(\"my_other_table\", new Cell(...)); // adds to the 'cells2' object a new Cell associated to \"my_other_table\"  \n</pre>\n<h2><a id=\"user-content-changes-to-objects-hierarchy\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#changes-to-objects-hierarchy\"></a>Changes to objects hierarchy</h2>\n<ul><li>IDeepJobConfig interface has been splitted into ICassandraDeepJobConfig and IMongoDeepJobConfig sub-interfaces. Each sub-interface exposes only the configuration properties that make sense for each data base.\ncom.stratio.deep.config.DeepJobConfigFactory's factory methods now return the proper subinterface.</li>\n<li><strong>DeepSparkContext</strong> has been splitted into <strong>CassandraDeepSparkContext</strong> and <strong>MongoDeepSparkContext</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>DeepJobConfigFactory</strong> has been renamed to <strong>ConfigFactory</strong> (to reduce verbosity).</li>\n</ul><h2><a id=\"user-content-rdd-creation\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#rdd-creation\"></a>RDD creation</h2>\n<p>Methods used to create Cell and Entity RDD has been merged into one single method:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>DeepSparkContext</strong>: createRDD(...)</li>\n</ul></article>",

        "title": "MySQL to Cassandra Migrations",
        "url": "https://academy.datastax.com/planet-cassandra/mysql-to-cassandra-migration",
        "content": "<p>For 15+ years, Oracle’s MySQL has been a de facto infrastructure piece in web applications, enjoying wide adoption. This is for good reason: MySQL provides a solid relational database that enables companies to build systems that perform well in many use cases. Yet, even its strongest supporters admit that it is not architected to tackle the new wave of big data applications. Modern businesses that need to manage big data use cases are turning to Apache Cassandra to replace MySQL.</p><p>Migrating from MySQL to Cassandra: General Info</p><h3>Is Cassandra Right for Your Application?</h3><p>A new class of databases (sometimes referred to as “NoSQL”) have been developed and designed with 18+ years worth of lessons learned from traditional relational databases such as MySQL. Cassandra (and other distributed or “NoSQL” databases) aim to make the “right” tradeoffs to<br />ultimately deliver a database that provides the scalability, redundancy, and performance needed in todays applications. Although MySQL may have performed well for you in the past, new business requirements and/or the need to both scale and improve the reliability of your application might mean that MySQL is no longer the correct fit.</p><p>Before committing any further time towards a MySQL to Cassandra migration, ask yourself:<br />“Is MySQL currently preventing development of new features or providing acceptable uptime, reliability, and scalability for my users?”</p><p>“No”: Not only should you not migrate to Cassandra, but also you most likely should not be considering a migration to any alternative database. Migrating an application to a new database is a very difficult, time consuming, and error-prone process.</p><p>“Yes”: Then hopefully you’ve found a helpful resource to help guide and plan your migration from MySQL to Cassandra. There are many databases<br />available, all with their various advantages, disadvantages and tradeoffs. This article is not an attempt to portray Cassandra as a perfect solution; in fact, Cassandra’s tradeoffs, advantages, and disadvantages will be highlighted. Hopefully this will help you make a decision that is both informed and educated; not one motivated by marketing hype or change for the sake of change.</p><p>Don’t try to shove a square peg in a round hole!</p><ul><li>Cassandra is not a relational database.</li>\n<li>Cassandra is not a 100%/“drop-in” replacement for MySQL.</li>\n<li>Simply migrating existing code to Cassandra without modifying and rethinking your existing data model will not result in perfect uptime or fix performance bottlenecks for your application. In fact, it might make things worse.</li>\n</ul><h3>Key Terminology</h3><p>The following overview of Cassandra terminology provides descriptions and their MySQL equivalent. The goal is to introduce the most basic terms and concepts required to get a basic understanding of Cassandra. To read more on the key terms and architecture of Cassandra you can find more detail in the <a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/architecture/architectureIntro_c.html\">Cassandra architecture documentation</a> or for a higher level overview visit the “<a href=\"http://planetcassandra.org/what-is-apache-cassandra/\">What is Cassandra</a>” page on Planet Cassandra.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://academy.datastax.com/sites/default/files/keyterms-1.png\" /></p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://academy.datastax.com/sites/default/files/keyterms-2.png\" /></p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://academy.datastax.com/sites/default/files/keyterms-3.png\" /></p><h3>How is Data Handled?</h3><p>At a very high level, Cassandra operates by dividing all data evenly around a cluster of nodes, which can be visualized as aring. Nodes generally run on commodity hardware. Each Cassandra node in the cluster is responsible for and assigned a token range (which is essentially a range of hashes defined by a partitioner, which defaults to Murmur3Partitioner in Cassandra v1.2+). By default this hash range is defined with a maximum number of possible hash values ranging from 0 to 2^127-1.</p><p>Each update or addition of data contains a unique row key (also known as a primary key). The primary key is hashed to determine a replica (or node) responsible for a token range inclusive of a given row key. The data is then stored in the cluster<strong>n</strong> times (where <strong>n</strong> is defined by the keyspace’s replication factor), or once on each replica responsible a given query’s row key. All nodes in Cassandra are peers and a client’s read or write request can be sent to any node in the cluster, regardless of whether or not that node actually contains and is responsible for the requested data. There is no concept of a master or slave, and nodes dynamically learn about each other and the state and health of other nodes thru the gossip protocol. A node that receives a client query is referred to as the coordinator for the client operation; it facilitates communication between all replica nodes responsible for the query (contacting at least n replica nodes to satisfy the query’s consistency level) and prepares and returns a result to the client.</p><h3>Reads and Writes</h3><p>Clients may interface with Cassandra for reads and writes via either the native binary protocol or Thrift. CQL queries can be made over both transports. As a general recommendation, if you are just getting started with Cassandra you should stick to the native binary protocol and CQL and ignore Thrift.</p><p>When a client performs a read or write request, the coordinator node contacts the number of required replicas to satisfy the consistency level included with each request. For example, if a read request is processed using QUORUM consistency, and the keyspace was created with a “replication factor” of 3, 2 of the 3 replicas for the requested data would be contacted, their results merged, and a single result returned to the client. With write requests, the coordinator node will send a write requests with all mutated columns to all replica nodes for a given row key.</p><h3>Processing a Local Update</h3><p>When an update is processed – also known as a mutation — an entry is first added to the commit log, which ensures durability of the transaction. Next, it is also added to the memtable. A memtable is a bounded in memory write-back cache that contains recent writes which have not yet been flushed to an SSTable (a permanent, immutable, and serialized on disk copy of the tables data).</p><p>When updates cause a memtable to reach it’s configured maximum in-memory size, the memtable is flushed to an immutable SSTable, persisting the data from the memtable permanently on disk while making room for future updates. In the event of a crash or node failure, events are replayed from the commit log, which prevents the loss of any data from memtables that had not been flushed to disk prior to an unexpected event such as a power outage or crash.</p><h3>Distributed Computing</h3><p>Distributed logic and designs will inevitably cause an increase in complexity in application logic. When done right however, the rewards are obvious and easy to appreciate. Operationally, while it might be possible to get away with a single non-sharded MySQL instance installed via apt-get/emerge/yum/etc., operations with Cassandra need to be taken seriously to achieve desired performance and uptime of the cluster. Or, if you currently shard data across multiple MySQL instances, knowing that Cassandra deals with sharding and replication for you might be a huge benefit and upsell for Cassandra. But, unfortunately there is no such thing as a free lunch. For example, although Cassandra will remove all of your homegrown database abstraction and sharding code, you ultimately ended simply moving that logic from your code to Cassandra. Luckily, given the number of people and corporations of all sizes using Cassandra in production combined with an engaged and involved community, it’s fair to assume and argue that Cassandra’s equivalent of your MySQL sharding code will be better than your old homegrown solution.</p><h2>Development Considerations</h2><h3>Be Thoughtful About Your Data Model</h3><p>Creating a thoughtful and conscious data model in Cassandra from the very beginning is very important. A bad data model can easily ruin and erase any of the benefits you want by migrating to Cassandra in the first place. With MySQL, the lack of a thoughtful or poor data model can frequently be worked around and accommodated thanks to the various relational database features (for example, the use of complex JOINS).<br />While these MySQL queries might be slow and expensive, given enough time and resources it’s possible to get the exact desired result from the dataset. With Cassandra, it is much harder to retroactively “fix” a poor data model. First, the lack of JOINS in Cassandra removes complex reads as a hacked solution to a bad data model. Additionally, thanks to the power and architecture of Cassandra, it becomes very easy to store more rows and data than imaginable with MySQL. With increased amounts of data stored, comes an increased complexity in successfully getting the exact data needed within the given performance boundaries required by your application. A SELECT query containing only 30 rows will return quickly and predictably. Performing a query over 5 million rows requires processing significantly more IO. Just as more data in MySQL made complex JOINS more difficult, accommodating for a Cassandra data model that requires the iteration over multiple nodes and rows will be slow, inefficient, and most likely not work at all. Obviously, faster database responses are always better in any application; so don’t let your data model be the cause of slow database latency in your application!</p><h3>Denormalization</h3><p>Denormalization is the concept that a data model should be designed so that a given query can be served from the results from one row and query. Instead of doing multiple reads from multiple tables and rows to gather all the required data for a response, instead modify your application logic to insert the required data multiple times into every row that might need it in the future. This way, all required data can be available in just one read which prevents multiple lookups.</p><h2>Operational Considerations</h2><h3>Optimization and Tuning Cassandra</h3><p>There are lots of options to tweak in Cassandra. Much like turning the treble, bass, and volume nobs of your car’s sound system all to 11 won’t sound very good to your ears, it’s easy to do more harm than good when “optimizing” Cassandra and it’s many nobs and dials.</p><p>Options such as key cache and row cache are two great examples. In a MySQL world, much of the configuration tuning is spent on optimizing the various amounts of cache allocated. In the Cassandra world, these settings actually tend to decrease node and cluster stability. Cassandra is written in Java, and thus it must operate within the limitations of Java. One of the biggest considerations is Garbage Collection and the maximum size of the heap possible without running into large garbage collection related issues, which will crater the performance of Cassandra. As of JDK7 with CMS (the default in Cassandra 1.2.x and 2.0.x) the maximum recommended size of the heap is 8GB. This 8GB must be shared between all of the various Cassandra components. 2GB allocated to the key cache will (obviously) put another 2GB of pressure on the heap. Caches are an optimization not a requirement, so allocating more memory to caches should be considered as part of the big picture. If you can allocate the full 8GB to Cassandra, a suggestion would be to start with allocating no more than 768MB to the key cache (key_cache_size_in_mb) and 0MB to the row cache (row_cache_size_in_mb).</p><p>Another example is multithreaded_compaction. While this might seem like an obvious option to enable, in most cases leaving this option disabled can actually improve overall cluster stability and performance. In many cases, less is more.</p><h2>Migration Plan Considerations</h2><h3>Maintaining Data Integrity</h3><p>Sometimes the most difficult component of a migration is not in writing a set of reliable scripts to read from MySQL and insert into Cassandra, but trivial coding mistakes that can cause significant data discrepancies between the MySQL and Cassandra versions of the data.</p><p>Because migrating from MySQL to Cassandra will most likely require a change in your data model, the logic required to “convert” your relational MySQL data to it’s de-normalized form is the hardest part of the migration and certainly has the biggest risk.</p><p>Treat your migration scripts and logic not as one-off instances, but production quality code that can be run in any order, at any time. Mistakes in migration logic that result in an inconsistent version of the migrated data in Cassandra most likely will have a much greater impact than other dataset migration related bugs.</p><h3>Get to Know Bulk Loading</h3><p>Regardless of your migration strategy, in almost all cases you will have to perform an initial bulk import of your existing MySQL data into Cassandra. While it might be tempting to simply iterate over every MySQL result and then insert that result one mutation at a time into Cassandra, a more efficient way is to use the Cassandra Bulk Loader. At a high level, the Bulk Loader requires you to create a CSV file containing all of the rows and columns that need to be loaded into Cassandra. Using the Java class SSTableSimpleUnsortedWriter, you can create an SSTable from your CSV file, which can then be loaded directly into Cassandra using SSTableloader.</p><p>For more details and code samples reference the article at <a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/bulk-loading\">http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/bulk-loading</a></p><h3>Migration Methods</h3><p>Sync Data Method:<br />When migrating to Cassandra and choosing a new data model might significantly increase your database workload. Alternatively, you might still need a live dataset in MySQL after the initial migration for legacy scripts that have not yet been migrated to use Cassandra.</p><p>Syncing from MySQL to Cassandra<br />In some cases it might not be practicable to add Cassandra to a legacy application. In this case it might be necessary to have an external process sync data from MySQL to Cassandra while running both new and old logic in parallel.</p><p>Suggestion:<br />Add a timestamp column to the MySQL table to be synced. With each update to MySQL also update the timestamp with the last updated time. At a scheduled interval then do a SELECT query from all MySQL shards where the last updated timestamp is greater than or equal to the time your last sync started.</p><p>Syncing from Cassandra back to MySQL<br />Some data models will be hard to sync from Cassandra back to MySQL (for example time series data). However, rows containing more de-normalized<br />“metadata”-like information can be synced.</p><p>What won’t work: Creating a sync script that executes via cron every n minutes and attempts to do a SELECT * FROM TABLE from Cassandra (and<br />then update and insert all of those records into MySQL) is a recipe for failure. Inherent to Cassandra’s design is that data is sharded across multiple nodes by a hash of it’s key. Performing a SELECT * query is a Cassandra anti-pattern and should be avoided. Iterating through every key across all nodes and returning a single paged dataset is both inefficient and impractical.</p><p>1st Suggestion:<br />Implement a queue that your application additionally writes to when it modifies a row in Cassandra. Have a script consume from this queue and de-duplicate the modified keys on a time interval and then bulk insert updates into MySQL.</p><p>2nd Suggestion:<br />If the data can be updated less frequently into MySQL, you could write a Hadoop Map/Reduce job that iterates over the column families that you need to sync. This solution gives a practicable and reproducible way to iterate through all keys in a column family. Using this approach as an additional sanity option to resolve missed updates from other incremental sync options.</p><p>3rd Suggestion:<br />Another option if you can afford a greater delay in the delta between updates from Cassandra back to MySQL is to use a tool such as SSTable2JSON to dump a column families SSTables into a JSON format, which can then be parsed and then used to update MySQL. This is a pretty heavy-handed method. Additionally, you’ll have to write logic to ensure you dump the SSTables from all nodes to get the entire column family.</p><p>Write Twice and Forget Method:<br />If you are able to modify your existing application to also interface with Cassandra, you can initially start your migration by writing database updates twice, once to MySQL and an additional time to Cassandra. Once you have all new updates being written to both MySQL and Cassandra, you can run a migration script that pages through all your existing MySQL data and inserts those records into Cassandra.</p><p>Initially, you might want to implement this second write to Cassandra as a completely non-blocking, write and forget, operation. If you experience initial issues during your Cassandra deployment, make sure not to impact your existing application when Cassandra is down.</p><p>Once you are satisfied with the fire-and-forget writes, you can slowly modify your application logic to start performing reads from Cassandra instead of MySQL. Thanks to the dual writes, if you run into issues, simply revert back to doing reads from MySQL.</p><h2>Use Cases and Migration Resources</h2><h3>Use Cases</h3><p><a href=\"http://planetcassandra.org/blog/post/youve-got-scale-aol-migrates-from-mysql-to-apache-cassandra-for-8x-improvement/\">AOL</a><br />AOL migrated their article index, in use for several AOL technologies form MySQL.

        "content": "<strong>Item</strong> <strong>Rational</strong> <strong><em>Schema</em></strong>  Is it properly denormalised? Does it require multiple queries to fetch information, or could the table just include info from the other table? Is there potential to consolidate data from multiple tables? Developers from relational background may tend to normalised models resulting in inefficient use of Cassandra. Partition key cardinality allows high number of partitions (minimum 100,000 possible preferred) A low number of partitions will lead to inefficient read and writes and increase risk of unevenly sized partitions Partition key prevents substantial skewing of partitions? If it is possible for a small number of partitions to have vastly higher numbers of rows than average (say 100x) then this can cause significantly uneven performance and disk usage. Using collections (maps,list,set)? Number of elements is 64k, keep the total size of the collect small (&lt;1MB) as the map is not paged. Very large collections can negatively  impact read/write performance. Is  gc_grace_seconds changed from default (864000)? If so, is that appropriate and impact considered? Lowering gc_crace_seconds results in space being reclaimed more quickly after deletes but runs small risk of “resurrected deletes” given we only run repairs weekly. Is caching set to KEYS_ONLY or NONE? Row caching for Cassandra 2.0 is often not effective. 2.1 row caching features may be effective if tuned correctly (see <a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/row-caching-in-cassandra-2-1\">row-caching-in-cassandra-2-1</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.1/cassandra/operations/ops_monitoring_cache_c.html\">Cassandra Docs</a>) Is chosen compaction strategy appropriate?  <ul><li>SizeTieredCompactionStrategy: default and suitable as a starting point for most uses cases with balance of reads and writes</li> <li>LevelledCompactionStrategy: does more compaction work to improve read performance. Generally used if high ratio of reads to writes.</li> <li>DateTieredCompactionStrategy: useful for data where data is “hot” when first written but sees less access over time.</li> <li>Check that the compaction strategy is appropriately tuned (see <a href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.1/cassandra/operations/ops_configure_compaction_t.html\">Cassandra Docs</a>) defaults are usually ok, but DTCS requires specific compaction options set to be effective.</li> </ul> Are counters used? Instaclustr only supports the use of counters with Cassandra 2.1 as Cassandra 2.0 counters are unreliable in many circumstances.   <strong><em>Secondary Indexes</em></strong>  Is cardinality of secondary index low? Cardinality of index should be at least an order of magnitude lower and preferable at least 100x lower than indexed table. <p>Also secondary indexes on boolean columns are not effective.</p> <p>See <a href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/cql/3.1/cql/ddl/ddl_when_use_index_c.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cassandra Docs</a> and</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.wentnet.com/blog/?p=77\">http://www.wentnet.com/blog/?p=77</a></p> Is the indexed column frequently updated/deleted? Overhead of maintaining index will be incurred on each update/delete and may also result in excessive tombstones in the index table.   <strong><em>Queries</em></strong>  Are there logged batches used? If so, are they relatively small (&lt;100) Logged batches require coordinate node to control all operations and can result in very high load on coordinator node for large batches. Logged batches are only required for atomic operations across multiple rows/tables (not performance). Are there unlogged batches? If so, are they small (&lt;100) or on the same partition key? Unlogged batches can improve performance but need to either be small or on a single partition key otherwise they can negatively impact performance. Not that unlogged batches do not provide atomic operations. For large range queries, is the client paging through results? Paging is necessary to read large results sets without memory constraints. Most drivers have inbuilt paging support but needs to be explicitly turned on in query code.   <p>Does the query on the index lookup a row in a large partition?</p>   <p>Whole partition will be scanned to find matching rows – potentially expensive reads.</p>",

This post was very popular and led me to think about what advice we could provide on how to approach designing your Cassandra data model so as to come up with a quality design that avoids the traps.</p>\n<p>There are a number of good articles around that with rules and patterns to fit your data model into: <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/resource/6-step-guide-to-apache-cassandra-data-modelling-white-paper/\" target=\"_blank\">6 Step Guide to Apache Cassandra Data Modelling</a> and <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://support.instaclustr.com/hc/en-us/articles/207071957-Data-Modelling-Recommended-Practices\" target=\"_blank\">Data Modelling Recommended Practices</a>.</p>\n<p>However, we haven’t found a step by step guide to analysing your data to determine how to fit in these rules and patterns. This white paper is a quick attempt at filling that gap.</p>\n<h2>Phase 1: Understand the data</h2>\n<p>This phase has two distinct steps that are both designed to gain a good understanding of the data that you are modelling and the access patterns required.</p>\n<h3>Define the data domain</h3>\n<p>The first step is to get a good understanding of your data domain. As someone very familiar with relation data modelling, I tend to sketch (or at least think) ER diagrams to understand the entities, their keys and relationships. However, if you’re familiar with another notation then it would likely work just as well. The key things you need to understand at a logical level are:</p>\n<p>• What are the entities (or objects) in your data model?<br />• What are the primary key attributes of the entities?<br />• What are the relationships between the entities (i.e. references from one to the other)?<br />• What is the relative cardinality of the relationships (i.e. if you have a one to many is it one to 10 or one to 10,000 on average)?</p>\n<p>Basically, these are the same things you’d expect in from logical ER model (although we probably don’t need a complete picture of all the attributes) along with a complete understanding of the cardinality of relationships that you’d normally need for a relational model. An understanding of the demographics of key attributes (cardinality, distribution) will also be useful in finalising your Cassandra model. Also, understand which key attributes are fixed and which change over the life of a record.</p>\n<h2>Define the required access patterns</h2>\n<p>The next step, or quite likely a step carried out in conjunction with step 1, is to understand how you will need to access your data:</p>\n<ul><li>List out the paths you will follow to access the data, such as:           \n<ul><li>Start with a customer id, search for transactions in a date range and then look up all the details about a particular transaction from the search resultsStart with a particular server and metric, retrieve x metrics values in ascending age</li>\n<li>Start with a particular server and metric, retrieve x metrics values in ascending age starting at a particular point in time.</li>\n<li>For a given sensor, retrieve all readings of multiple metrics for a given day.</li>\n<li>For a given sensor, retrieve the current value.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul><ul><li>Remember that any updates of a record are an access path that needs to be considered</li>\n<li>Determine which accesses are the most crucial from a performance point of view – are there some which need to be as quick as possible while performance requirements for others allow time for multiple reads or range scans?</li>\n<li>Remember that you need a pretty complete understanding of how you will access your data at this stage – part of the trade-off for Cassandra’s performance, reliability and scalability is a fairly restricted set of methods for accessing data in a particular table.</li>\n</ul><h2>Phase 2: Understand the entities</h2>\n<p>This phase has two specific steps designed to gain an understanding of both the primary and secondary entities associated with the data.</p>\n<h3>Identify primary access entities</h3>\n<p>Now we’re moving from analysing your data domain and application requirements to starting to design your data model. You really want to be pretty solid on steps 1 and 2 before moving on to this stage.</p>\n<p>The idea here is to denormalize your data into the smallest number of tables possible based on your access patterns. For each lookup by key that your access patterns require, you will need a table to satisfy that lookup. I’ve coined the term primary access entity to describe the entity your using for the lookup (for example, a lookup by client id is using client as the primary access entity, a lookup by server and metric name is using a server-metric entity as the primary access entity).</p>\n<p>The primary access entity defines the partition level (or grain if you’re familiar with dimensional modelling) of the resulting denormalized table (i.e. there will be one partition in the table for each instance of the primary access entity).</p>\n<p>You may choose to satisfy some access patterns using secondary indexes rather than complete replicas of the data with a different primary access entity. Keep in mind that columns in include in a secondary index should have a significantly lower cardinality than the table being indexed and be aware of the frequency of updates of the indexed value.</p>\n<p>For the example access patterns above, we would define the following primary access entities:</p>\n<ul><li>customer and transaction (get a list of transactions from the customer entity and then use that to look up transaction details from the transaction entity)</li>\n<li>server-metric</li>\n<li>sensor</li>\n<li>sensor</li>\n</ul><h3>Allocate secondary entities</h3>\n<p>The next step is to find a place to store the data that belongs to entities that have not been chosen as primary access entities (I’ll call these entities secondary entities). You can choose to:</p>\n<ul><li>Push down by taking data from a parent secondary entity (one side) of a one to many relationship and storing multiple copies of it at the primary access entity level (for example, storing customer phone number in each customer order record); or</li>\n<li>Push up by taking data from the child secondary entity (many side) of a one to many relationship and storing it at the primary access entity level either by use of cluster keys or by use of multi-value types (list and maps) (for example adding a list of line items to a transaction level table).</li>\n</ul><p>For some secondary entities, there will only be one related primary access entity and so there is no need to choose where and which direction to push. For other entities, you will need to choose will need to choose which primary access entities to push the data into.</p>\n<p>For optimal read performance, you should push a copy of the data to every primary access entity that is used as an access path for the data in the secondary entity.</p>\n<p>However, this comes at an insert/update performance and application complexity cost of maintaining multiple copies the data. This trade-off between read performance and data maintenance cost needs to be judged in the context of the specific performance requirements of your application.</p>\n<p>The other decision to be made at this stage is between using a cluster key or a multi-value type for pushing up. In general:</p>\n<ul><li>Use a clustering key where there is only one child secondary entity to push up and particularly where the child secondary entity itself has children to roll-up.</li>\n<li>Use multi-value types where there are multiple child entities to push up into the primary entity</li>\n</ul><p>Note that these rules are probably oversimplified but serve as a starting point for more detailed consideration.</p>\n<h2>Phase 3: Review &amp; Tune</h2>\n<p>The last phase provides an opportunity to review the data model, test and to tune as necessary.</p>\n<h3>Review partition &amp; cluster keys</h3>\n<p>Entering this stage, you have all the data you need to store allocated to a table or tables and your tables support accessing that data according to your required access patterns. The next step is to check that the resulting data model makes efficient use of Cassandra and, if not, to adjust. The items to check and adjust at this stage are:</p>\n<ul><li>Do your partition keys have sufficient cardinality? If not, it may be necessary to move columns from the clustering key to the partition key (e.g. changing primary key (client_id, timestamp) to primary key ((client_id, timestamp))) or introduce new columns which group multiple cluster keys into partitions (e.g. changing primary key (client_id, timestamp) to primary key ((client_id, day), timestamp).</li>\n<li>Will the values in your partition keys be updated frequently?Updates of a primary key value will result in deletion and re-insertion of the record which can result in issues with tombstones. For example, trying to maintain a table with all clients of a particular status, you might have primary key (status, client ID). However, this will result in a delete and re-insert every time a client’s status changes. This would be a good candidate to use a set or list data type rather than including client ID as the cluster key.</li>\n<li>Is the number of records in each partition bounded? Extremely large partitions and/or very unevenly sized partitions can cause issues. For example, if you have a client_updates table with primary key (client_id, update_timestamp) there is potentially no limit to how many times a particular client record can be update and you may have significant unevenness if you have a small number of clients that have been around for 10 years and most clients only having a day or two’s history. This is another example where it’s useful to introduce new columns which group multiple cluster keys into partitions partitions (e.g. changing primary key (client_ id, update_timestamp) to primary key ((client_id, month), update_timestamp).</li>\n</ul><h3>Test and tune</h3>\n<p>The final step is perhaps the most important – test your data model and tune it as required. Keep in mind that issues like partitions or rows growing too large or tombstones building up in a table may only become visible after days (or longer) of use under real-world load. It’s therefore important to test as closely as possible to real-world load and to monitor closely for any warning signs (the nodetool cfstats and cfhistograms commands are very useful for this).</p>\n<p>At this stage you may also consider tuning some of the settings that effect the physical storage of your data. For example:</p>\n<ul><li>changing compaction strategy;</li>\n<li>reducing gc_grace_seconds if you are only deleting data using TTL; or</li>\n<li>setting caching options.</li>\n</ul><h2>A Worked Example</h2>\n<p>To illustrate this, I’ll walk through a basic example based on building a database to store and retrieve log messages from multiple servers. Note this is quite simplified compared to most real-world requirements.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Define the data domain</h3>\n<p><a class=\"fbx-link fbx-instance\" href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Defining-the-data-domain-Instaclustr-Data-model-Design.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6928 size-large\" src=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Defining-the-data-domain-Instaclustr-Data-model-Design-1024x616.png\" alt=\"Defining the data model domain Instaclustr Data Model design\" width=\"1024\" height=\"616\" /></a></p>\n<p>The previous ER diagram illustrated the data domain. We have:</p>\n<ul><li>Lots (millions) of log messages which have a timestamp and a body. Although message ID is shown as the primary key in the ER diagram, message time plus message type is an alternate primary key.</li>\n<li>Each log message has a message type and types are further grouped into a message category (for example, a message type might be “out of memory error” and category might be “error”). There a couple of hundred message types and around 20 categories.</li>\n<li>Each log message comes from a message source. The message source is the server that generated the message. There are 1000s of servers in our system. Each message source has a source type to categorise the source (e.g. red hat server, ubuntu server, windows server, router, etc.). There are around 20 source types. There are ~10,000 messages per source per day.</li>\n<li>The message body can be parsed and stored as multiple message parts (basically key, value pairs). There is typically less than 20 parts per message.</li>\n</ul><h3>Step 2: Define the required access patterns</h3>\n<p>We need to be able to:</p>\n<ul><li>Retrieve all available information about the most recent 10 messages for a given source (and be able to work back in time from there).</li>\n<li>Retrieve all available information about the most recent 10 message for a given source type.</li>\n</ul><h3>Step 3: Identify primary access entities</h3>\n<p>There are two primary access entities here – source and source type. The cardinality (~20) of source type makes it a good candidate for a secondary index so we will use source as the primary access entity and add a secondary index for source type.</p>\n<h3>Step 4: Allocate secondary entities</h3>\n<p>In this example, this step is relatively simple as all data needs to roll into the log source primary access entity. So we:</p>\n<ul><li>Push down source type name</li>\n<li>Push down message category and message type to log message</li>\n<li>Push up log message as the clustering key for the new entity</li>\n<li>Push up message part as a map type with.</li>\n</ul><p>The end result is that would be a single table with a partition key of source ID and a clustering key of (message time, message type).</p>\n<h3>Step 5: Review partition and cluster keys</h3>\n<p>Checking these partition and cluster keys against the checklist:</p>\n<ul><li>Do your partition keys have sufficient cardinality? Yes, there are 1000s of sources.</li>\n<li>Will the values in your partition keys being updated frequently? No, all the data is write-once.</li>\n<li>Is the number of records in each partition bounded? No – messages could build up indefinitely over time.</li>\n</ul><p>So, we need to address the unbound partition size. A typical pattern to address that in time series data such as this is to introduce a grouping of time periods into the cluster key. In this case 10,000 messages per day is a reasonable number to include in one partition so we’ll use day as part of our partition key.</p>\n<p>The resulting Cassandra table will look some like:</p>\n<div id=\"crayon-5a0099a71ecf5394143671\" class=\"crayon-syntax crayon-font-monaco crayon-os-pc print-yes notranslate crayon-theme-sublime-text\">\n<div class=\"crayon-main\">\n<table class=\"crayon-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"crayon-row\"><td class=\"crayon-nums\">\n</td>\n<td class=\"crayon-code\">\n<div class=\"crayon-pre\">\n<div id=\"crayon-5a0099a71ecf5394143671-1\" class=\"crayon-line\">CREATE TABLE example.log_messages (</div>\n<div id=\"crayon-5a0099a71ecf5394143671-2\" class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\">message_id uuid,</div>\n<div id=\"crayon-5a0099a71ecf5394143671-3\" class=\"crayon-line\">source_name text,</div>\n<div id=\"crayon-5a0099a71ecf5394143671-4\" class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\">source_type text,</div>\n<div id=\"crayon-5a0099a71ecf5394143671-5\" class=\"crayon-line\">message_type text,</div>\n<div id=\"crayon-5a0099a71ecf5394143671-6\" class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\">message_urgency int,</div>\n<div id=\"crayon-5a0099a71ecf5394143671-7\" class=\"crayon-line\">message_category text,</div>\n<div id=\"crayon-5a0099a71ecf5394143671-8\" class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\">message_time timestamp,</div>\n<div id=\"crayon-5a0099a71ecf5394143671-9\" class=\"crayon-line\">message_time_day text,</div>\n<div id=\"crayon-5a0099a71ecf5394143671-10\" class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\">message_body text,</div>\n<div id=\"crayon-5a0099a71ecf5394143671-11\" class=\"crayon-line\">message_parts map&amp;lt;text, frozen &amp;gt;</div>\n<div id=\"crayon-5a0099a71ecf5394143671-13\" class=\"crayon-line\">PRIMARY KEY ((source_name, message_time_day,</div>\n<div id=\"crayon-5a0099a71ecf5394143671-14\" class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\">message_time, message_type)</div>\n<div id=\"crayon-5a0099a71ecf5394143671-15\" class=\"crayon-line\">) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (message_time DESC);</div>\n<div id=\"crayon-5a0099a71ecf5394143671-16\" class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\">CREATE INDEX log_messages_sourcetype_idx ON</div>\n<div id=\"crayon-5a0099a71ecf5394143671-17\" class=\"crayon-line\">example.log_messages (source_type);</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr></tbody></table></div>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Hopefully, this process and basic example will help you start to get familiar with Cassandra data modelling.

        "content": "<p>One of the big challenges people face when starting out working with Cassandra and time series data is understanding the impact of how your write workload will affect your cluster.  Writing too quickly to a single partition can create hot spots that limit your ability to scale out. Partitions that get too large can lead to issues with repair, streaming, and read performance.  Reading from the middle of a large partition carries a lot of overhead, and results in increased GC pressure.  Cassandra 4.0 should <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-9754\">improve the performance of large partitions</a>, but it won’t fully solve the other issues I’ve already mentioned.  For the foreseeable future, we will need to consider their performance impact and plan for them accordingly.</p><p>In this post, I’ll discuss a common Cassandra data modeling technique called <em>bucketing</em>.  Bucketing is a strategy that lets us control how much data is stored in each partition as well as spread writes out to the entire cluster.  This post will discuss two forms of bucketing. These techniques can be combined when a data model requires further scaling.  Readers should already be familiar with the anatomy of a partition and basic CQL commands.</p>\n<p>When we first learn about data modeling with Cassandra, we might see something like the following:</p>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre>CREATE TABLE raw_data (\n    sensor text,\n    ts timeuuid,\n    readint int,\n    primary key(sensor, ts)\n) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (ts DESC) \n  AND compaction = {'class': 'TimeWindowCompactionStrategy', \n                    'compaction_window_size': 1, \n                    'compaction_window_unit': 'DAYS'};\n</pre></div></div>\n<p>This is a great first data model for storing some very simple sensor data.  Normally the data we collect is more complex than an integer, but in this post we’re going to focus on the keys.  We’re leveraging <a href=\"http://thelastpickle.com/blog/2016/12/08/TWCS-part1.html\">TWCS</a> as our compaction strategy.  TWCS will help us deal with the overhead of compacting large partitions, which should keep our CPU and I/O under control.  Unfortunately it still has some significant limitations.  If we aren’t using a TTL, as we take in more data, our partition size will grow constantly, unbounded.  As mentioned above, large partitions carry significant overhead when repairing, streaming, or reading from arbitrary time slices.</p>\n<p>To break up this big partition, we’ll leverage our first form of bucketing.  We’ll break our partitions into smaller ones based on time window.  The ideal size is going to keep partitions under 100MB.  For example, one partition per sensor per day would be a good choice if we’re storing 50-75MB of data per day.  We could just as easily use week (starting from some epoch), or month and year as long as the partitions stay under 100MB.  Whatever the choice, leaving a little headroom for growth is a good idea.</p>\n<p>To accomplish this, we’ll add another component to our partition key.  Modifying our earlier data model, we’ll add a <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">day</code> field:</p>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre>CREATE TABLE raw_data_by_day (\nsensor text,\nday text,\nts timeuuid,\nreading int,\nprimary key((sensor, day), ts)\n) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (ts DESC) \n       AND COMPACTION = {'class': 'TimeWindowCompactionStrategy', \n                     'compaction_window_unit': 'DAYS', \n                     'compaction_window_size': 1};\n</pre></div></div>\n<p>Inserting into the table requires using the date as well as the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">now()</code> value (you could also generate a TimeUUID in your application code):</p>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre>INSERT INTO raw_data_by_day (sensor, day, ts, reading) \nVALUES ('mysensor', '2017-01-01', now(), 10);\n</pre></div></div>\n<p>This is one way of limiting the amount of data per partition.  For fetching large amounts of data across multiple days, you’ll need to issue one query per day.  The nice part about querying like this is we can spread the work over the entire cluster rather than asking a single node to perform a lot of work.  We can also issue these queries in parallel by relying on the async calls in the driver.  The Python driver even has a convenient helper function for this sort of use case:</p>\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre>from itertools import product\nfrom cassandra.concurrent import execute_concurrent_with_args\ndays = [\"2017-07-01\", \"2017-07-12\", \"2017-07-03\"]  # collecting three days worth of data\nsession  = Cluster([\"127.0.0.1\"]).connect(\"blog\")\nprepared = session.prepare(\"SELECT day, ts, reading FROM raw_data_by_day WHERE sensor = ? and day = ?\")\nargs = product([\"mysensor\"], days) \n# args: ('test', '2017-07-01'), ('test', '2017-07-12'), ('test', '2017-07-03')\n# driver handles concurrency for you\nresults = execute_concurrent_with_args(session, prepared, args)\n# Results:\n#[ExecutionResult(success=True, result_or_exc=&lt;cassandra.cluster.ResultSet object at 0x106d36750&gt;),\n# ExecutionResult(success=True, result_or_exc=&lt;cassandra.cluster.ResultSet object at 0x106d36a90&gt;),\n# ExecutionResult(success=True, result_or_exc=&lt;cassandra.cluster.ResultSet object at 0x106d36550&gt;)]\n</pre></div></div>\n<p>A variation on this technique is to use a different table per time window.  For instance, using a table per month means you’d have twelve tables per year:</p>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre>CREATE TABLE raw_data_may_2017 (\n    sensor text,\n    ts timeuuid,\n    reading int,\n    primary key(sensor, ts)\n) WITH COMPACTION = {'class': 'TimeWindowCompactionStrategy', \n                     'compaction_window_unit': 'DAYS', \n                     'compaction_window_size': 1};\n</pre></div></div>\n<p>This strategy has a primary benefit of being useful for archiving and quickly dropping old data.  For instance, at the beginning of each month, we could archive last month’s data to HDFS or S3 in parquet format, taking advantage of cheap storage for analytics purposes.  When we don’t need the data in Cassandra anymore, we can simply drop the table.  You can probably see there’s a bit of extra maintenance around creating and removing tables, so this method is really only useful if archiving is a requirement.  There are other methods to archive data as well, so this style of bucketing may be unnecessary.</p>\n<p>The above strategies focuses on keeping partitions from getting too big over a long period of time.  This is fine if we have a predictable workload and partition sizes that have very little variance.  It’s possible to be ingesting so much information that we can overwhelm a single node’s ability to write data out, or the ingest rate is significantly higher for a small percentage of objects.  Twitter is a great example, where certain people have tens of millions of followers but it’s not the common case.  It’s common to have a separate code path for these types of accounts where we need massive scale</p>\n<p>The second technique uses multiple partitions at any given time to fan out inserts to the entire cluster.  The nice part about this strategy is we can use a single partition for low volume, and many partitions for high volume.</p>\n<p>The tradeoff we make with this design is on reads we need to use a scatter gather, which has significantly higher overhead.  This can make pagination more difficult, amongst other things.  We need to be able to track how much data we’re ingesting for each gizmo we have.  This is to ensure we can pick the right number of partitions to use.  If we use too many buckets, we end up doing a lot of really small reads across a lot of partitions.  Too few buckets, we end up with really large partitions that don’t compact, repair, stream well, and have poor read performance.</p>\n<p>For this example, we’ll look at a theoretical model for someone who’s following a lot of users on a social network like Twitter.  Most accounts would be fine to have a single partition for incoming messages, but some people / bots might follow millions of accounts.</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: I have no knowledge of how Twitter is actually storing their data, it’s just an easy example to discuss.</em></p>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre>CREATE TABLE tweet_stream (\n    account text,\n    day text,\n    bucket int,\n    ts timeuuid,\n    message text,\n    primary key((account, day, bucket), ts)\n) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (ts DESC) \n         AND COMPACTION = {'class': 'TimeWindowCompactionStrategy', \n                       'compaction_window_unit': 'DAYS', \n                       'compaction_window_size': 1};\n</pre></div></div>\n<p>This data model extends our previous data model by adding <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">bucket</code> into the partition key.  Each day can now have multiple buckets to fetch from.  When it’s time to read, we need to fetch from all the partitions, and take the results we need.  To demonstrate, we’ll insert some data into our partitions:</p>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre>cqlsh:blog&gt; insert into tweet_stream (account, day, bucket, ts, message) VALUES ('jon_haddad', '2017-07-01', 0, now(), 'hi');\ncqlsh:blog&gt; insert into tweet_stream (account, day, bucket, ts, message) VALUES ('jon_haddad', '2017-07-01', 1, now(), 'hi2');\ncqlsh:blog&gt; insert into tweet_stream (account, day, bucket, ts, message) VALUES ('jon_haddad', '2017-07-01', 2, now(), 'hi3');\ncqlsh:blog&gt; insert into tweet_stream (account, day, bucket, ts, message) VALUES ('jon_haddad', '2017-07-01', 3, now(), 'hi4');\n</pre></div></div>\n<p>If we want the ten most recent messages, we can do something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre>from itertools import chain\nfrom cassandra.util import unix_time_from_uuid1\nprepared = session.prepare(\"SELECT ts, message FROM tweet_stream WHERE account = ? and day = ? and bucket = ?

If we wanted to grab a lot more elements we’d want to use a k-way merge algorithm.  We’ll come back to that in a future blog post when we expand on this topic.</p>\n<p>At this point you should have a better understanding of how you can distribute your data and requests around the cluster, allowing it to scale much further than if a single partition were used.  Keep in mind each problem is different, and there’s no one size fits all solution.</p>",

It’s useful for managing large quantities of data across multiple data centers as well as the cloud.</p><h3 id=\"cassandra-data-model\">Cassandra data model</h3><p>Cassandra’s data model consists of keyspaces, column families, keys, and columns. The table below compares each part of the Cassandra data model to its analogue in a relational data model.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Cassandra Data Model</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Relational Data Model</strong></th>\n</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Keyspace</td>\n<td>Database</td>\n</tr><tr><td>Column Family</td>\n<td>Table</td>\n</tr><tr><td>Partition Key</td>\n<td>Primary Key</td>\n</tr><tr><td>Column Name/Key</td>\n<td>Column Name</td>\n</tr><tr><td>Column Value</td>\n<td>Column Value</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><h3 id=\"how-cassandra-organizes-data\">How Cassandra organizes data</h3><p>Cassandra organizes data into partitions. Each partition consists of multiple columns. Partitions are stored on a node. Nodes are generally part of a cluster where each node is responsible for a fraction of the partitions.</p><p>When inserting records, Cassandra will hash the value of the inserted data’s partition key; Cassandra uses this hash value to determine which node is responsible for storing the data.</p><h3 id=\"where-are-the-rows\">Where are the rows?</h3><p>Cassandra is a column data store, meaning that each partition key has a set of one or more columns. Let’s say we have a list of fruits:</p><ul><li>[Apple, Banana, Orange, Pear]</li>\n</ul><p>We create a column family of fruits, which is essentially the same as a table in the relational model. Inside our column family, Cassandra will hash the name of each fruit to give us the partition key, which is essentially the primary key of the fruit in the relational model.</p><p>Now things start to diverge from the relational model. Cassandra will store each fruit on its own partition, since the hash of each fruit’s name will be different. Because each fruit has its own partition, it doesn’t map well to the concept of a row, as Cassandra has to issue commands to potentially four separate nodes to retrieve all data from the fruit column family.</p><p>We’ll get into more details later, but for now it’s enough to know that for Cassandra to look up a set of data (or a set of rows in the relational model), we have to store all of the data under the same partition key. To summarize, rows in Cassandra are essentially data embedded within a partition due to the fact that the data share the same partition key.</p><h3 id=\"data-model-goals\">Data model goals</h3><ol><li>Spread data evenly around the cluster. Paritions are distributed around the cluster based on a hash of the partition key. To distribute work across nodes, it’s desirable for every node in the cluster to have roughly the same amount of data.</li>\n<li>Minimize the number of partitions read. Partitions are groups of columns that share the same partition key. Since each partition may reside on a different node, the query coordinator will generally need to issue separate commands to separate nodes for each partition we query.</li>\n<li>Satisfy a query by reading a single partition. This means we will use roughly one table per query. Supporting multiple query patterns usually means we need more than one table. Data duplication is encouraged.</li>\n</ol><h3 id=\"components-of-the-cassandra-data-model\">Components of the Cassandra data model</h3><p><strong>Column family</strong></p><p>Column families are established with the CREATE TABLE command. Column families are represented in Cassandra as a map of sorted maps. The partition key acts as the lookup value; the sorted map consists of column keys and their associated values.</p><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">Map&lt;ParitionKey, SortedMap&lt;ColumnKey, ColumnValue&gt;&gt;</pre></div><p><strong>Partition key</strong></p><p>The partition key is responsible for distributing data among nodes. A partition key is the same as the primary key when the primary key consists of a single column.</p><p><img src=\"https://shermandigital.com/img/blog/cassandra-partition.png\" alt=\"Cassandra partition\" /></p><p>Partition keys belong to a node. Cassandra is organized into a cluster of nodes, with each node having an equal part of the partition key hashes.</p><p>Imagine we have a four node Cassandra cluster. In the example cluster below, Node 1 is responsible for partition key hash values 0-24; Node 2 is responsible for partition key hash values 25-49; and so on.</p><p><img src=\"https://shermandigital.com/img/blog/cassandra-cluster.png\" alt=\"Cassandra cluster\" /></p><p><strong>Replication factor</strong></p><p>Depending on the replication factor configured, data written to Node 1 will be replicated in a clockwise fashion to its sibling nodes. So in our example above, assume we have a four-node cluster with a replication factor of three. When we insert data with a partition key of 23, the data will get written to Node 1 and replicated to Node 2 and Node 3. When we insert data with a partition key of 88, the data will get written to Node 4 and replicated to Node 1 and Node 2.</p><p><strong>Compound key</strong></p><p>Compound keys include multiple columns in the primary key, but these additional columns do not necessarily affect the partition key. A partition key with multiple columns is known as a composite key and will be discussed later.</p><p>Let’s borrow an example from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamHutson\">Adam Hutson’s</a> excellent <a href=\"http://datascale.io/cassandra-data-model-basics/\">blog on Cassandra data modeling</a>. Consider a Cassandra database that stores information on CrossFit gyms. One property of CrossFit gyms is that each gym must have a unique name i.e. no two gyms are allowed to share the same name.</p><p>The table below is useful for looking up a gym when we know the name of the gym we’re looking for.</p><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">CREATE TABLE crossfit_gyms (  \n   gym_name text,  \n   city text,  \n   state_province text,  \n   country_code text,  \n   PRIMARY KEY (gym_name)  \n);</pre></div><p>Now suppose we want to look up gyms by location. If we use the crossfit_gyms table, we’ll need to iterate over the entire result set. Instead, we’ll create a new table that will allow us to query gyms by country.</p><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">CREATE TABLE crossfit_gyms_by_location (  \n   country_code text,  \n   state_province text,  \n   city text,  \n   gym_name text,  \n   PRIMARY KEY (country_code, state_province, city, gym_name)  \n);</pre></div><p>Note that only the first column of the primary key above is considered the partition key; the rest of columns are clustering keys. This means that while the primary key represents a unique gym record/row, all gyms within a country reside on the same partition. So when we query the crossfit_gyms_by_location table, we receive a result set consisting of every gym sharing a given country_code. While useful for searching gyms by country, using this table to identify gyms within a particular state or city requires iterating over all gyms within the country in which the state or city is located.</p><p><strong>Clustering key</strong></p><p>Clustering keys are responsible for sorting data within a partition. Each primary key column after the partition key is considered a clustering key. In the crossfit_gyms_by_location example, country_code is the partition key; state_province, city, and gym_name are the clustering keys. Clustering keys are sorted in ascending order by default. So when we query for all gyms in the United States, the result set will be ordered first by state_province in ascending order, followed by city in ascending order, and finally gym_name in ascending order.</p><p><strong>Order by</strong></p><p>To sort in descending order, add a WITH clause to the end of the CREATE TABLE statement.</p><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">CREATE TABLE crossfit_gyms_by_location (  \n   country_code text,  \n   state_province text,  \n   city text,  \n   gym_name text,  \n   PRIMARY KEY (country_code, state_province, city, gym_name)  \n) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (state_province DESC, city ASC, gym_name ASC);</pre></div><p> The result set will now contain gyms ordered first by state_province in descending order, followed by city in ascending order, and finally gym_name in ascending order. You must specify the sort order for each of the clustering keys in the ORDER BY statement. The partition key is not part of the ORDER BY statement because its values are hashed and therefore won’t be close to each other in the cluster.</p><p><strong>Composite key</strong></p><p>Composite keys are partition keys that consist of multiple columns. The crossfit_gyms_by_location example only used country_code for partitioning. The result is that all gyms in the same country reside within a single partition. This can lead to wide rows. In the case of our example, there are over 7,000 CrossFit gyms in the United States, so using the single column partition key results in a row with over 7,000 combinations.</p><p>To avoid wide rows, we can move to a composite key consisting of additional columns. If we change the partition key to include the state_province and city columns, the partition hash value will no longer be calculated off only country_code. Now, each combination of country_code, state_province, and city will have its own hash value and be stored in a separate partition within the cluster. We accomplish this by nesting parenthesis around the columns we want included in the composite key. </p><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">CREATE TABLE crossfit_gyms_by_city (  \n country_code text,  \n state_province text,  \n city text,  \n gym_name text,  \n opening_date timestamp,  \n PRIMARY KEY ((country_code, state_province, city), opening_date, gym_name)  \n) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY ( opening_data ASC, gym_name ASC );</pre></div><p>Notice that we are no longer sorting on the partition key columns. Each combination of the partition keys is stored in a separate partition within the cluster.</p><p>When issuing a CQL query, you must include all partition key columns, at a minimum. You can then apply an additional filter by adding each clustering key in the order in which the clustering keys appear. Below you can see valid queries and invalid queries from our crossfit_gyms_by_city example.</p><p><strong>Valid queries:</strong></p><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">SELECT * FROM crossfit_gyms_by_city WHERE country_code = 'USA' and state_province = 'VA' and city = 'Arlington'</pre></div><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">SELECT * FROM crossfit_gyms_by_city WHERE country_code = 'USA' and state_province = 'VA' and city = 'Arlington' and opening_date &lt;  '2015-01-01 00:00:00+0200'</pre></div><p><strong>Invalid queries:</strong></p><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">SELECT * FROM crossfit_gyms_by_city WHERE country_code = 'USA' and state_province = 'VA'</pre></div><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">SELECT * FROM crossfit_gyms_by_city WHERE country_code = 'USA' and state_province = 'VA' and city = 'Arlington' and gym_name = 'CrossFit Route 7'</pre></div><p>The first invalid query is missing the city partition key column. The second invalid query uses the clustering key gym_name without including the preceding clustering key opening_date.</p><p>The reason the order of clustering keys matters is because the clustering keys provide the sort order of the result set. Because of the clustering key’s responsibility for sorting, we know all data matching the first clustering key will be adjacent to all other data matching that clustering key.</p><p>In our example, this means all gyms with the same opening date will be grouped together in alphabetical order. Gyms with different opening dates will appear in temporal order.</p><p>Because we know the order, CQL can easily truncate sections of the partition that don’t match our query to satisfy the WHERE conditions pertaining to columns that are not part of the partition key. However, because the clustering key gym_name is secondary to clustering key opening_date, gyms will appear in alphabetical order only for gyms opened on the same day (within a particular city, in this case). Therefore, we can’t specify the gym name in our CQL query without first specifying an opening date.</p><h3 id=\"internal-data-structure\">Internal data structure</h3><p>If we create a column family (table) with CQL:</p><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">CREATE TABLE crossfit_gyms (  \n gym_name text PRIMARY KEY,  \n country_code text,  \n state_province text,  \n city text  \n);</pre></div><p> And insert a row:</p><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">INSERT INTO crossfit_gyms (country_code, state_province, city, gym_name) VALUES ('USA', 'CA', 'San Francisco', 'San Francisco CrossFit');</pre></div><p>Assuming we don’t encode the data, it is stored internally as:</p><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">Partition Key: San Francisco CrossFit  \n=&gt;(column=, value=, timestamp=1374683971220000)  \n=&gt;(column=city, value='San Francisco', timestamp=1374683971220000)  \n=&gt;(column=country_code, value='USA', timestamp=1374683971220000)  \n=&gt;(column=state_province, value='CA', timestamp=1374683971220000)</pre></div><p>You can see that the partition key is used for lookup. In this case the first column is also the partition key, so Cassandra does not repeat the value. The next three columns hold the associated column values.</p><p>If we use a composite key, the internal structure changes a bit. Let’s start with a general example borrowed from <a href=\"https://www.gitbook.com/@teddyma\">Teddy Ma’s</a> <a href=\"https://teddyma.gitbooks.io/learncassandra/content/index.html\">step-by-step guide to learning Cassandra</a>.</p><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">CREATE TABLE example (\n    partitionKey1 text,\n    partitionKey2 text,\n    clusterKey1 text,\n    clusterKey2 text,\n    normalField1 text,\n    normalField2 text,\n    PRIMARY KEY (\n        (partitionKey1, partitionKey2),\n        clusterKey1, clusterKey2\n        )\n    );</pre></div><p>And insert a row:</p><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">INSERT INTO example (\n    partitionKey1,\n    partitionKey2,\n    clusterKey1,\n    clusterKey2,\n    normalField1,\n    normalField2\n    )  VALUES (\n    'partitionVal1',\n    'partitionVal2',\n    clusterVal1',\n    'clusterVal2',\n    'normalVal1',\n    'normalVal2');</pre></div><p>This data is stored internally as:</p><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">RowKey: partitionVal1:partitionVal2\n=&gt; (column=clusterVal1:clusterVal2:, value=, timestamp=1374630892473000)\n=&gt; (column=clusterVal1:clusterVal2:normalfield1, value=6e6f726d616c56616c31, timestamp=1374630892473000)\n=&gt; (column=clusterVal1:clusterVal2:normalfield2, value=6e6f726d616c56616c32, timestamp=1374630892473000)</pre></div><p>The composite key columns are concatenated to form the partition key (RowKey). The clustering keys are concatenated to form the first column and then used in the names of each of the following columns that are not part of the primary key. The actual values we inserted into normalField1 and normalField2 have been encoded, but decoding them results in normalValue1 and normalValue2, respectively.</p><p>Now we can adapt this to our CrossFit example.</p><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">CREATE TABLE crossfit_gyms_by_state (  \n   country_code text,  \n   state_province text,  \n   city text,  \n   gym_name text,  \n   opening_date timestamp,  \n   street text,  \n   PRIMARY KEY (  \n      (country_code, state_province),  \n      city, gym_name  \n   )  \n);</pre></div><p>And insert a row:</p><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">INSERT INTO crossfit_gyms_by_state (  \n   country_code,   \n   state_province,   \n   city,   \n   gym_name,   \n   opening_date,  \n   street  \n)   \nVALUES (  \n   'USA',   \n   'CA',  \n   'San Francisco',   \n   'San Francisco CrossFit',  \n   '2015-01-01 00:00:00+0200',  \n   '1162A Gorgas Ave');\n   </pre></div><p>For the sake of readability, I won’t encode the values of the columns. The internal structure is approximately:</p><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">Partition Key: USA:CA  \n=&gt;(column='San Francisco':'San Francisco CrossFit', value=, timestamp=1374683971220000)  \n=&gt;(column='San Francisco':'San Francisco CrossFit':'​opening_date', value='2015-01-01 00:00:00+0200', timestamp=1374683971220000)  \n=&gt;(column='San Francisco':'San Francisco CrossFit':'​street', value='1162A Gorgas Ave', timestamp=1374683971220000)</pre></div><p>Finally, we’ll show how Cassandra represents sets, lists, and maps internally. Once again, we’ll use an example from <a href=\"https://www.gitbook.com/@teddyma\">Teddy Ma’s</a> <a href=\"https://teddyma.gitbooks.io/learncassandra/content/index.html\">step-by-step guide to learning Cassandra</a>.</p><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">CREATE TABLE example (  \n   key1 text PRIMARY KEY,  \n   map1 map&lt;text,text&gt;,  \n   list1 list&lt;text&gt;,  \n   set1 set&lt;text&gt;  \n);</pre></div><p>Insert a row:</p><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">INSERT INTO example (  \n   key1,  \n   map1,  \n   list1,  \n   set1  \n) VALUES (  \n   'john',  \n   {'patricia':'555-4326','doug':'555-1579'},  \n   ['doug','scott'],  \n   {'patricia','scott'}  \n);</pre></div><p>Internally:</p><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">RowKey: john  \n=&gt; (column=, value=, timestamp=1374683971220000)  \n=&gt; (column=map1:doug, value='555-1579', timestamp=1374683971220000)  \n=&gt; (column=map1:patricia, value='555-4326', timestamp=1374683971220000)  \n=&gt; (column=list1:26017c10f48711e2801fdf9895e5d0f8, value='doug', timestamp=1374683971220000)  \n=&gt; (column=list1:26017c12f48711e2801fdf9895e5d0f8, value='scott', timestamp=1374683971220000)  \n=&gt; (column=set1:'patricia', value=, timestamp=1374683971220000)  \n=&gt; (column=set1:'scott', value=, timestamp=1374683971220000)</pre></div><p>To store maps, Cassandra adds a column for each item in the map. The column name is a concatenation of the the column name and the map key. The value is the key’s value.</p><p>To store lists, Cassandra adds a column for each entry in the list. The column name is a concatenation of the the column name and a UUID generated by Cassandra. The value is the value of the list item.</p><p>To store sets, Cassandra adds a column for each entry. The column name is a concatenation of the the column name and the entry value. Cassandra does not repeat the entry value in the value, leaving it empty.</p><h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3><p>You now have enough information to begin designing a Cassandra data model. Remember to work with the unstructured data features of Cassandra rather than against them. Designing a data model for Cassandra can be an adjustment coming from a relational database background, but the ability to store and query large quantities of data at scale make Cassandra a valuable tool.</p><h3 id=\"appendix\">Appendix</h3><p><strong>Cassandra Features</strong></p><ul><li>Continuous availability. The peer-to-peer replication of data to nodes within a cluster results in no single point of failure. This is true even across data centers.</li>\n<li>Linear performance when scaling nodes in a cluster. If three nodes are achieving 3,000 writes per second, adding three more nodes will result in a cluster of six nodes achieving 6,000 writes per second.</li>\n<li>Tunable consistency. If we want to replicate data across three nodes, we can have a replication factor of three, yet not necessarily wait for all three nodes to acknowledge the write. Data will eventually be written to all three nodes, but we can acknowledge the write after writing the data to one or more nodes without waiting for the full replication to finish.</li>\n<li>Flexible data model. Every row can have a different number of columns with support for many types of data.</li>\n<li>Query language (CQL) with a SQL-like syntax.</li>\n<li>Support for Java Monitoring Extensions (JMX). Metrics about performance, latency, system usage, etc. are available for consumption by other applications.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Cassandra Limitations</strong></p><ul><li>No join or subquery support for aggregation. According to Cassandra’s documentation, this is by design, encouraging denormalization of data into partitions that can be queried efficiently from a single node, rather than gathering data from across the entire cluster.</li>\n<li>Ordering is set at table creation time on a per-partition basis. This avoids clients attempting to sort billions of rows at run time.</li>\n<li>All data for a single partition must fit on disk in a single node in the cluster.</li>\n<li>It’s recommended to keep the number of rows within a partition below 100,000 items and the disk size under 100 MB.</li>\n<li>A single column value is limited to 2 GB (1 MB is recommended).</li>\n</ul><p>A less obvious limitation of Cassandra is its lack of row-level consistency. Modifications to a column family (table) that affect the same row and are processed with the same timestamp will result in a tie.</p><p>In the event of a tie Cassandra follows two rules:</p><ol><li>Deletes take precedence over inserts/updates.</li>\n<li>If there are two updates, the one with the lexically larger value wins.</li>\n</ol><p>This means for inserts/updates, Cassandra resolves row-level ties by comparing values at the column (cell) level, writing the greater value. This can result in one update modifying one column while another update modifies another column, resulting in rows with combinations of values that never existed.</p><p class=\"margin-top-25\">\n<i class=\"fa fa-tag color-medium-gray\">\n<a href=\"https://shermandigital.com/tags/cassandra\" class=\"margin-right-10\">\nCassandra\n</a>\n</i></p><noscript><p>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=\"https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript\">comments powered by Disqus.</a></p></noscript>",

The ring represents a cyclic range of token values (i.e., the token space).  Each node is assigned a position on the ring based on its token.   A node is responsible for all tokens between its initial token and the initial token of the closest previous node along the ring.</p></div><div class=\"col-md-12 content-html\"><p>Keys are mapped into the token space by a partitioner. The important distinction between the partitioners is order preservation (OP). Users can define their own partitioners by implementing IPartitioner, or they can use one of the native partitioners:</p><table border=\"1\" style=\"width: 467px;\"><thead><tr><td class=\"left_th_colored\" style=\"width: 196px;\"> </td>\n   <td class=\"right_th_colored\" style=\"width: 73px;\">Map Function</td>\n   <td class=\"right_th_colored\" style=\"width: 80px;\">Token Space</td>\n   <td class=\"right_th_colored\" style=\"width: 90px;\">OP</td>\n  </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"left_td_colored\">RandomPartitioner</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">MD5</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">BigInteger</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">No</td>\n  </tr><tr><td class=\"left_td_colored\">BytesOrderPartitioner</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">Identity</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">Bytes</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">Yes</td>\n  </tr></tbody></table><p>The following examples illustrate this point.</p><h3>Random Partitioner</h3><p>Since the Random Partitioner uses an MD5 hash function to map keys into tokens, on average those keys will evenly distribute across the cluster. For this reason, RandomPartitioner is the default partitioner.</p><p>The row key determines the node placement:</p><table border=\"1\" style=\"width: 537px;\"><thead><tr><td class=\"left_th_colored\" style=\"width: 84px;\">Row Key</td>\n   <td class=\"right_th_colored\" style=\"width: 116px;\"> </td>\n   <td class=\"right_th_colored\" style=\"width: 172px;\"> </td>\n   <td class=\"right_th_colored\" style=\"width: 137px;\"> </td>\n  </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"left_td_colored\">Lisa</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">state: CA</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">graduated: 2008</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">gender: F</td>\n  </tr><tr><td class=\"left_td_colored\">Owen</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">state: TX</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">gender: M</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\"> </td>\n  </tr><tr><td class=\"left_td_colored\">Collin</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">state: UT</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">gender: M</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\"> </td>\n  </tr></tbody></table><p>This may result in following ring formation, where \"collin\", \"owen\", and \"lisa\" are rowkeys.</p><p><img alt=\"“Random\" class=\"fr-dii fr-fil\" src=\"https://dzone.com/storage/rc-covers/14344-thumb.png\" /></p><p>With Cassandra’s storage model, where each node owns the preceding token space, this results in the following storage allocation based on the tokens.</p><table border=\"1\" style=\"width: 258px;\"><thead><tr><td class=\"left_th_colored\" style=\"width: 41px;\">Row Key</td>\n   <td class=\"right_th_colored\" style=\"width: 142px;\">MD5 Hash</td>\n   <td class=\"right_th_colored\" style=\"width: 53px;\">Node</td>\n  </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"left_td_colored\">collin</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">CC982736AD62AB</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">3</td>\n  </tr><tr><td class=\"left_td_colored\">owen</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">9567238FF72635</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">2</td>\n  </tr><tr><td>lisa</td>\n   <td>001AB62DE123FF</td>\n   <td>1</td>\n  </tr></tbody></table><p>Notice that the keys are not in order. With RandomPartitioner, the keys are evenly distributed across the ring using hashes, but you sacrifice order, which means any range query needs to query all nodes in the ring.</p><h3>Order Preserving Partitioners (OPP)</h3><p>The Order Preserving Partitioners preserve the order of the row keys as they are mapped into the token space.  </p><p>In our example, since:</p><p><em> \"collin\" &lt; \"lisa\" &lt; \"owen\"</em></p><p>then,</p><p><em>token(\"collin\") &lt; token(\"lisa\") &lt; token(\"owen\")</em></p><p>With OPP, range queries are simplified and a query may not need to consult each node in the ring.  This seems like an advantage, but it comes at a price.  Since the partitioner is preserving order, the ring may become unbalance unless the rowkeys are naturally distributed across the token space.  </p><p>This is illustrated below. </p><p><img alt=\"“OPP”\" class=\"fr-dii fr-fil\" src=\"https://dzone.com/storage/rc-covers/14345-thumb.png\" /></p><p>To manually balance the cluster, you can set the initial token for each node in the Cassandra configuration.</p><div class=\"../images/hot_tip.gif\">\n <p><img alt=\"Hot Tip\" class=\"../images/hot_tip.gif_icon fr-dii fr-fil\" src=\"https://dzone.com/storage/rc-covers/14346-thumb.png\" /></p> If possible, it is best to design your data model to use RandomPartitioner to take advantage of the automatic load balancing and decreased administrative overhead of manually managing token assignment. \n</div></div><div class=\"col-md-12 content-html\"><p>Cassandra provides high availability and fault tolerance through data replication.  The replication uses the ring to determine nodes used for replication.   Each keyspace has an independent replication factor, <em>n</em>.  When writing information, the data is written to the target node as determined by the partitioner and <em>n-1 </em>subsequent nodes along the ring.</p><p>There are two replication strategies: SimpleStrategy and NetworkTopologyStrategy.</p><h3>SimpleStrategy</h3><p>The SimpleStrategy is the default strategy and blindly writes the data to subsequent nodes along the ring.  In the previous example with a replication factor of <em>2</em>, this would result in the following storage allocation.</p><table border=\"1\" style=\"width: 469px;\"><thead><tr><td class=\"left_th_colored\" style=\"width: 59px;\">Row Key</td>\n   <td class=\"right_th_colored\" style=\"width: 179px;\">Replica 1 <br />(as determined by partitioner)</td>\n   <td class=\"right_th_colored\" style=\"width: 209px;\">Replica 2<br />(found by traversing the ring)</td>\n  </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"left_td_colored\">collin</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">3</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">1</td>\n  </tr><tr><td class=\"left_td_colored\">owen</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">2</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">3</td>\n  </tr><tr><td class=\"left_td_colored\">lisa</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">1</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">2</td>\n  </tr></tbody></table><h3>NetworkTopologyStrategy</h3><p>The NetworkTopologyStrategy is useful when deploying to multiple data centers. It ensures data is replicated across data centers.</p><p>Effectively, the NetworkTopologyStrategy executes the SimpleStrategy independently for each data center, spreading replicas across distant racks. Cassandra writes a copy in each data center as determined by the partitioner. Data is written simultaneously along the ring to subsequent nodes within that data center with preference for nodes in different racks to offer resilience to hardware failure. All nodes are peers and data files can be loaded through any node in the cluster, eliminating the single point of failure inherent in master-slave architecture and making Cassandra fully fault-tolerant and highly available.</p><p>Given the following ring and deployment topology:</p><p><img alt=\"“Topology&amp;quot;\" class=\"fr-dii fr-fil\" src=\"https://dzone.com/storage/rc-covers/14347-thumb.png\" /></p><p>With blue nodes (N1-N3) deployed to one data center (DC1), red nodes (N4-N6) deployed to another data center (DC2), and a replication factor of 4, Cassandra would write a row with key “lisa” as follows.</p><p>NOTE: Cassandra attempts to write data simultaneously to all target nodes then waits for confirmation from the relevant number of nodes needed to satisfy the specified consistency level. </p><h3>Consistency Levels</h3><p>One of the unique characteristics of Cassandra that sets it apart from other databases is its approach to consistency.  Clients can specify the consistency level on both read and write operations trading off between high availability, consistency, and performance.</p><h3>Write</h3><table border=\"1\" style=\"width: 545px;\"><thead><tr><td class=\"left_th_colored\" style=\"width: 130px;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n   <th class=\"right_th_colored\" style=\"width: 399px;\"><strong>Expectation</strong></th>\n  </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"left_td_colored\">ANY</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">The write was logged, but the data may not be available for reads immediately.

racks or data centers.  It is the default setting and is useful for simple deployments where all servers are collocated.</p><h3>PropertyFileSnitch</h3><p>The PropertyFileSnitch allows users to be explicit about their network topology.  The user specifies the topology in a properties file, <em>cassandra-topology.properties. </em> The file specifies which nodes belong to which racks and data centers.  Below is an example property file for our sample cluster.</p><p><em># DC1<br />192.168.0.1=DC1:RAC1<br />192.168.0.2=DC1:RAC1<br />192.168.0.3=DC1:RAC2</em></p><p># DC2<br

It uses Amazon's API to examine the regions to which nodes are deployed. It then treats each region as a separate data center.</p><p>EC2MultiRegionSnitch</p><p>Use this snitch for deployments on Amazon EC2 where the cluster spans multiple regions. This snitch treats data centers and availability zones as racks within a data center and uses public IPs as broadcast_address to allow cross-region connectivity. Cassandra nodes in one EC2 region can bind to nodes in another region, thus enabling multi-data center support.</p></div><div class=\"col-md-12 content-html\"><p>Cassandra provides simple primitives. Its simplicity allows it to scale linearly with high availability and very little performance degradation.   That simplicity allows for extremely fast read and write operations for specific keys, but servicing more sophisticated queries that span keys requires pre-planning.</p><p>Using the primitives that Cassandra provides, you can construct indexes that support exactly the query patterns of your application.  Note, however, that queries may not perform well without properly designing your schema. </p><h3>Secondary Indexes</h3><p>To satisfy simple query patterns, Cassandra provides a native indexing capability called Secondary Indexes. A column family may have multiple secondary indexes. A secondary index is hash-based and uses specific columns to provide a reverse lookup mechanism from a specific column value to the relevant row keys. Under the hood, Cassandra maintains hidden column families that store the index. The strength of Secondary Indexes is allowing queries by value. Secondary indexes are built in the background automatically without blocking reads or writes. To create a Secondary Index using CQL is straight-forward. For example, define a table of data about movie fans, and then create a secondary index of states where they live:</p><p>CREATE TABLE fans ( watcherID uuid, favorite_actor text, address text, zip int, state text PRIMARY KEY (watcherID) );</p><p>CREATE INDEX watcher_state ON fans (state);</p><h3>Range Queries</h3><p>It is important to consider partitioning when designing your schema to support range queries.</p><h4>Range Queries with Order Preservation</h4><p>Since order is preserved, order preserving partitioners better supports range queries across a range of rows.  Cassandra only needs to retrieve data from the subset of nodes responsible for that range.  For example, if we are querying against a column family keyed by phone number and we want to find all phone numbers between that begin with <em>215-555</em>, we could create a range query with start key <em>215-555-0000 </em>and end key <em>215-555-9999.</em></p><p>To service this request with OrderPreservingPartitioning, it’s possible for Cassandra to compute the two relevant tokens: <em>token(215-555-0000) </em>and<em> token(215-555-9999)</em>.</p><p>Then satisfying that querying simply means consulting nodes responsible for that token range and retrieving the rows/tokens in that range.</p><h4>Range Queries with Random Partitioning</h4><p>The RandomPartitioner provides no guarantees of any kind between keys and tokens.  In fact, ideally row keys are distributed around the token ring evenly.  Thus, the corresponding tokens for a start key and end key are not useful when trying to retrieve the relevant rows from tokens in the ring with the RandomPartitioner.  Consequently, Cassandra must consult all nodes to retrieve the result.  Fortunately, there are well known design patterns to accommodate range queries.  These are described below.</p><h3>Index Patterns</h3><p>There are a few design patterns to implement indexes.  Each services different query patterns.  The patterns leverage the fact that Cassandra columns are always stored in sorted order and all columns for a single row reside on a single host.</p><h3>Inverted Indexes</h3><p>First, let’s consider the <em>inverted index</em> pattern.  In an inverted index, columns in one row become row keys in another.  Consider the following data set, where users IDs are row keys.</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-spacing: 0px;

timestamp &gt; : &lt; event_field &gt;. Unless the data for each event is very large, this approach scales well with large data sets and provides efficient reads. Fetch a time slice of events by reading a contiguous portion of a row on one set of replicas. When you track the same event in multiple timelines, denormalizing and storing all of the event data in each of the timelines works well.</p><table border=\"1\" style=\"width: 455px;\"><thead><tr><td class=\"left_th_colored\" style=\"width: 445px;\"><strong>Materialized View Table</strong></td>\n  </tr></thead></table><table border=\"1\" style=\"width: 456px;\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"left_td_colored\" style=\"width: 97px;\">lsmith: 1332960000</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\" style=\"width: 220px;\">C4e1ee6f-e053-41f5-9890-<br />674636d51095:<br />{\"user\": \"lsmith\", \"body\": \"There<br />are . . . \"}</td>\n   <td class=\"left_td_colored\" style=\"width: 117px;\">39f71a85-7af0 . . .<br />{\"user\": \"lsmith\",<br />\"body\": \"Yes, . . .</td>\n  </tr><tr><td class=\"left_td_colored\">cbrown:<br />1332960000</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">e572bad1-f98d-4346-80a0-<br />13e7d37d38d0:<br />{\"user\":\"cbrown\", \"body\": \"My dog<br />is . . .\"}</td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\">aa33bgbfd-8f16 . . .<br />{\"user\":\"cbrown\",<br />\"body\":\"No, . . .</td>\n  </tr></tbody></table><p>When you use composite keys in CQL, Cassandra supports wide Cassandra rows using composite column names. In CQL 3, a primary key can have any number (1 or more) of component columns, but there must be at least one column in the column family that is not part of the primary key. The new wide row technique consumes more storage because for every piece of data stored, the column name is stored along with it.</p><p><em>CREATE TABLE History.events (<br />event uuid PRIMARY KEY,<br />author varchar,<br />body varchar);</em></p><p>CREATE TABLE timeline (<br />user varchar,<br />event uuid,<br />author varchar,<br />body varchar,</p><div class=\"../images/hot_tip.gif\">\n <p><img alt=\"Hot Tip\" class=\"../images/hot_tip.gif_icon fr-dii fr-fil\" src=\"https://dzone.com/storage/rc-covers/14348-thumb.png\" /></p> Wide-Row indexes can cause hotspots in the cluster.  Since the index is a single row, it is stored on a single node (plus replicas).  If that is a heavily used index, those nodes may be overwhelmed. \n</div><h3>Composite-Types in Indexes</h3><p>The previous examples were one-dimensional and used a simple concatenation to illustrate the point.  Instead, you may prefer to use composite keys and/or values in your data model.  </p><p>Using composite keys in indexes, we can create queries along multiple dimensions.  If we combine the previous examples, we could create a <br />single wide-row capable of serving a compound query such as, “How many users within the 18964 Zip Code are older than 21?”</p><p>Simply create a composite type containing the Zip Code and the date of birth and use that as the column name in the index.</p><h3>Denormalization</h3><p>Finally, it is worth noting that each of the indexing strategies as presented would require two steps to service a query if the request requires the actual column data (e.g., user name). The first step would retrieve the keys out of the index. The second step would fetch each relevant column by row key.</p><p>We can skip the second step if we denormalize the data. In Cassandra, denormalization is the norm. If we duplicate the data, the index becomes a true materialized view that is custom tailored to the exact query we need to support.</p></div><div class=\"col-md-12 content-html\"><p>Everything in Cassandra is a write, typically referred to as a mutation. Since Cassandra is effectively a key-value store, operations are simply mutations of a key/value pairs. The column is atomic, but the fundamental unit is a row in the ACID sense. If you have multiple updates to the same key, group the changes into a single update.</p><div class=\"../images/hot_tip.gif\">\n <p><img alt=\"Hot Tip\" class=\"../images/hot_tip.gif_icon fr-dii fr-fil\" src=\"https://dzone.com/storage/rc-covers/14349-thumb.png\" /></p> When performing multiple operations on the same key in sequence, be sure to increment the timestamp! Do not simply specify System.currentTimeMillis().  If the code executes too quickly, the mutations will have the same timestamp and Cassandra will not be able to determine the proper sequencing of events. \n</div><h3>Hinted Handoff</h3><p>Similar to ReadRepair, Hinted Handoff is a background process that ensures data integrity and eventual consistency.  If a replica is down in the cluster and the client requests a consistency level of ANY, a write may still succeed by writing a “hint” to a coordinator node, which will disseminate that data to replicas when they become available.</p></div><div class=\"col-md-12 content-html\"><p>Cassandra provides tools for operations and maintenance.  Some of the maintenance is mandatory because of Cassandra’s eventually consistent architecture.  Other facilities are useful to support alerting and statistics gathering.  Use <em>nodetool</em> to manage Cassandra.  Datastax provides a reference card on nodetool available here:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/DS_nodetool_web.pdf\">http://www.datastax.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/DS_nodetool_web.pdf</a></p><h3>Nodetool Repair</h3><p>Cassandra keeps record of deleted values for some time to support the eventual consistency of distributed deletes.  These values are called tombstones.  Tombstones are purged after some time (GCGraceSeconds, which defaults to 10 days).  Since tombstones prevent improper data propagation in the cluster, you will want to ensure that you have consistency before they get purged.</p><p>To ensure consistency, run:</p><p><em>&gt;$CASSANDRA_HOME/bin/nodetool repair</em></p><p>The repair command replicates any updates missed due to downtime or loss of connectivity. This command ensures consistency across the cluster and obviates the tombstones. You will want to do this periodically on each node in the cluster (within the window before tombstone purge).</p><h3>Monitoring</h3><p>Cassandra has support for monitoring via JMX, but the simplest way to monitor the Cassandra node is by using OpsCenter, which is designed to manage and monitor Cassandra database clusters. There is a free community edition as well as an enterprise edition that provides management of Apache SOLR and Hadoop.</p><p>Simply download mx4j and execute the following:</p><p><em>cp $MX4J_HOME/lib/mx4j-tools.jar $CASSANDRA_HOME/lib</em></p><p>The following are key attributes to track per column family.</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-spacing: 0px; width: 422px;\"><thead><tr><td class=\"left_th_colored\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 97px;\"><p><strong>Attribute</strong></p></td>\n   <td class=\"right_th_colored\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 319px;\"><p><strong>Provides</strong></p></td>\n  </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"left_td_colored\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 97px;\"><p>Read Count</p></td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 319px;\"><p>Frequency of reads against the column family.</p></td>\n  </tr><tr><td class=\"left_td_colored\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 97px;\"><p>Read Latency</p></td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 319px;\"><p>Latency of reads against the column family.</p></td>\n  </tr><tr><td class=\"left_td_colored\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 97px;\"><p>Write Count</p></td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 319px;\"><p>Frequency of writes against the column family.</p></td>\n  </tr><tr><td class=\"left_td_colored\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 97px;\"><p>Write Latency</p></td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 319px;\"><p>Latency of writes against the column family.</p></td>\n  </tr><tr><td class=\"left_td_colored\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 97px;\"><p>Pending Tasks</p></td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 319px;\"><p>Queue of pending tasks, informative to know if tasks are queuing.</p></td>\n  </tr></tbody></table><h3>Backup</h3><p>OpsCenter facilitates backing up data by providing snapshots of the data. A snapshot creates a new hardlink to every live SSTable. Cassandra also provides online backup facilities using nodetool. To take a snapshot of the data on the cluster, invoke:</p><p><em>$CASSANDRA_HOME/bin/nodetool snapshot</em></p><p>This will create a snapshot directory in each keyspace data directory.  Restoring the snapshot is then a matter of shutting down the node, deleting the commitlogs and the data files in the keyspace, and copying the snapshot files back into the keyspace directory.</p></div><div class=\"col-md-12 content-html\"><p>Cassandra has a very active community developing libraries in different languages.  </p><h3>Java</h3><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-spacing: 0px;\"><thead><tr><td class=\"left_th_colored\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 76px;\"><p><strong>Client</strong></p></td>\n   <td class=\"right_th_colored\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><p><strong>Description</strong></p></td>\n  </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"left_td_colored\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 76px;\"><p>Astyanax</p></td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><p>Inspired by Hector, Astyanax is a client library developed by the folks at Netflix.   <br /><a href=\"https://github.com/Netflix/astyanax\">https://github.com/Netflix/astyanax</a></p></td>\n  </tr><tr><td class=\"left_td_colored\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 76px;\"><p>Hector</p></td>\n   <td class=\"right_td_colored\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><p>Hector is one of the first APIs to wrap the underlying Thrift API.

        "content": "<p>\n     Entity Framework is an object-relational mapping framework that can be used to work with data as objects. While you can run the ADO.NET Entity Data Model wizard in Visual Studio to handle generating the Entity Model, this approach, the model-first approach, can put you at a disadvantage if there are changes in your data source or if you want more control over how the entities operate. In this article you will complete the code-first approach to accessing Cassandra data using the CData ADO.NET Provider.\n\t</p><ol><li>Open Visual Studio and create a new Windows Form Application. This article uses a C# project with .NET 4.5.</li>\n    <li>Run the command 'Install-Package EntityFramework' in the Package Manger Console in Visual Studio to install the latest release of Entity Framework.</li>\n    <li><p>Modify the App.config file in the project to add a reference to the Cassandra Entity Framework 6 assembly and the connection string.</p>\n\t   &#13;\n<p>&#13;\nSet the Server, Port, and Database connection properties to connect to Cassandra. Additionally, to use internal authentication set the User and Password connection properties.&#13;\n</p> \n<code lang=\"xml\" xml:lang=\"xml\">\n&lt;configuration&gt;\n   ... \n  &lt;connectionStrings&gt;\n    &lt;add name=\"CassandraContext\" connectionString=\"Offline=False;Database=MyCassandraDB;Port=7000;Server=127.0.0.1;\" providerName=\"System.Data.CData.Cassandra\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/connectionStrings&gt;\n  &lt;entityFramework&gt;\n    &lt;providers&gt;\n       ... \n      &lt;provider invariantName=\"System.Data.CData.Cassandra\" type=\"System.Data.CData.Cassandra.CassandraProviderServices, System.Data.CData.Cassandra.Entities.EF6\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/providers&gt;\n  &lt;entityFramework&gt;\n&lt;/configuration&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; \n</code>\n    </li>\n    <li>Add a reference to System.Data.CData.Cassandra.Entities.EF6.dll, located in the lib -&gt; 4.0 subfolder in the installation directory.\n    </li><li>\nBuild the project at this point to ensure everything is working correctly.  Once that's done, you can start coding using Entity Framework.\n  </li>\n\t\t<li>Add a new .cs file to the project and add a class to it. This will be your database context, and it will extend the DbContext class. In the example, this class is named CassandraContext. The following code example overrides the OnModelCreating method to make the following changes:\n<ul><li>Remove PluralizingTableNameConvention from the ModelBuilder Conventions.\n</li><li>Remove requests to the MigrationHistory table.\n</li></ul><code lang=\"csharp\" xml:lang=\"csharp\">\nusing System.Data.Entity;\nusing System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure;\nusing System.Data.Entity.ModelConfiguration.Conventions;\nclass CassandraContext : DbContext {\n  public CassandraContext() { }\n  protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)\n  {\n    // To remove the requests to the Migration History table\n    Database.SetInitializer&lt;CassandraContext&gt;(null);  \n    // To remove the plural names    \n    modelBuilder.Conventions.Remove&lt;PluralizingTableNameConvention&gt;();\n  }  \n}\n</code>\n  </li>\n    <li>Create another .cs file and name it after the Cassandra entity you are retrieving, for example, Customer. In this file, define both the Entity and the Entity Configuration, which will resemble the example below:\n    <code lang=\"csharp\" xml:lang=\"csharp\">\nusing System.Data.Entity.ModelConfiguration;\nusing System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;\n[System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema.Table(\"Customer\")]\npublic class Customer {\n  [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Key] \n  public System.String Id { get; set; }\n  public System.String City { get; set; }\n}\n    \n</code>\n  </li>\n    <li>Now that you have created an entity, add the entity to your context class:\n  \n<code lang=\"csharp\" xml:lang=\"csharp\">\npublic DbSet&lt;Customer&gt; Customer { set; get; }\n</code>\n  </li>\n    <li>With the context and entity finished, you are now ready to query the data in a separate class. For example: \n\t\n<code lang=\"csharp\" xml:lang=\"csharp\">\nCassandraContext context = new CassandraContext();\ncontext.Configuration.UseDatabaseNullSemantics = true;\nvar query = from line in context.Customer select line;\n</code>\n    </li>\n  </ol>",

Source documents are now stored in Cassandra, reducing disk space if you need a NoSQL database and Elasticsearch.</li>\n<li>Write operations are not more restricted to one primary shards, but distributed on all Cassandra nodes in a virtual datacenter.

        "content": "<div class=\"short_box short_start\">\n<h3><b>I just announced the new <em>Spring 5</em> modules in REST With Spring: </b></h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.baeldung.com/rest-with-spring-course#new-modules\" id=\"announcement_CTA\">&gt;&gt; CHECK OUT THE COURSE</a></strong></p>\n</div><h2><strong>1. Overview</strong></h2>\n<p>Cassandra is a NoSQL database that provides high availability and horizontal scalability without compromising performance.</p>\n<p>To get the best performance out of Cassandra, we need to carefully design the schema around query patterns specific to the business problem at hand.</p>\n<p>In this article, we will review some of the key concepts around <strong>how to approach data modeling in Cassandra</strong>.</p>\n<p>Before proceeding, you can go through our <a href=\"http://www.baeldung.com/cassandra-with-java\">Cassandra with Java</a> article to understand the basics and how to connect to Cassandra using Java.</p>\n<h2><strong>2. Partition Key<br /></strong></h2>\n<p>Cassandra is a distributed database in which data is partitioned and stored across multiple nodes within a cluster.</p>\n<p>The partition key is made up of one or more data fields and is <strong>used by the partitioner to generate a token via hashing to distribute the data uniformly across a cluster</strong>.</p>\n<h2><strong>3. Clustering Key<br /></strong></h2>\n<p>A clustering key is made up of one or more fields and helps in clustering or grouping together rows with same partition key and storing them in sorted order.</p>\n<p>Let’s say that we are storing time-series data in Cassandra and we want to retrieve the data in chronological order. A clustering key that includes time-series data fields will be very helpful for efficient retrieval of data for this use case.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: The combination of partition key and clustering key makes up the primary key and uniquely identifies any record in the Cassandra cluster.</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>4. Guidelines Around Query Patterns<br /></strong></h2>\n<p>Before starting with data modeling in Cassandra, we should identify the query patterns and ensure that they adhere to the following guidelines:</p>\n<ol><li>Each query should fetch data from a single partition</li>\n<li>We should keep track of how much data is getting stored in a partition, as Cassandra has limits around the number of columns that can be stored in a single partition</li>\n<li>It is OK to denormalize and duplicate the data to support different kinds of query patterns over the same data</li>\n</ol><p>Based on the above guidelines, let’s look at some real-world use cases and how we would model the Cassandra data models for them.</p>\n<h2><strong>5. Real World Data Modeling Examples<br /></strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>5.1. Facebook Posts</strong></h3>\n<p>Suppose that we are storing Facebook posts of different users in Cassandra. One of the common query patterns will be fetching the top ‘<em>N</em>‘ posts made by a given user.</p>\n<p>Thus, <strong>we need to</strong> <strong>store all data for a particular user on a single partition</strong> as per the above guidelines.</p>\n<p>Also, using the post timestamp as the clustering key will be helpful for retrieving the top ‘<em>N</em>‘ posts more efficiently.</p>\n<p>Let’s define the Cassandra table schema for this use case:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: sql; gutter: true\">CREATE TABLE posts_facebook (&#13;\n  user_id uuid,&#13;\n  post_id timeuuid, &#13;\n  content text,&#13;\n  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, post_id) )&#13;\nWITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (post_id DESC);</pre>\n<p>Now, let’s write a query to find the top 20 posts for the user <em>Anna</em>:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: sql; gutter: true\">SELECT content FROM posts_facebook WHERE user_id = \"Anna_id\" LIMIT 20</pre>\n<h3><strong>5.2. Gyms Across the Country</strong></h3>\n<p>Suppose that we are storing the details of different partner gyms across the different cities and states of many countries and we would like to fetch the gyms for a given city.</p>\n<p>Also, let’s say we need to return the results having gyms sorted by their opening date.</p>\n<p>Based on the above guidelines, we should store the gyms located in a given city of a specific state and country on a single partition and use the opening date and gym name as a clustering key.</p>\n<p>Let’s define the Cassandra table schema for this example:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: sql; gutter: true\">CREATE TABLE gyms_by_city (&#13;\n country_code text,&#13;\n state text,&#13;\n city text,&#13;\n gym_name text,&#13;\n opening_date timestamp,&#13;\n PRIMARY KEY (&#13;\n   (country_code, state_province, city), &#13;\n   (opening_date, gym_name)) &#13;\n WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (opening_date ASC, gym_name ASC);</pre>\n<p>Now, let’s look at a query that fetches the first ten gyms by their opening date for the city of Phoenix within the U.S. state of Arizona:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: sql; gutter: true\">SELECT * FROM gyms_by_city&#13;\n  WHERE country_code = \"us\" AND state = \"Arizona\" AND city = \"Phoenix\"&#13;\n  LIMIT 10</pre>\n<p class=\"brush: sql; gutter: true\">Next, let’s see a query that fetches the ten most recently-opened gyms in the city of Phoenix within the U.S. state of Arizona:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: sql; gutter: true\">SELECT * FROM gyms_by_city&#13;\n  WHERE country_code = \"us\" and state = \"Arizona\" and city = \"Phoenix\"&#13;\n  ORDER BY opening_date DESC &#13;\n  LIMIT 10</pre>\n<p>Note: As the last query’s sort order is opposite of the sort order defined during the table creation, the query will run slower as Cassandra will first fetch the data and then sort it in memory.</p>\n<h3><strong>5.3. E-commerce Customers and Products</strong></h3>\n<p>Let’s say we are running an e-commerce store and that we are storing the <em>Customer</em> and <em>Product</em> information within Cassandra. Let’s look at some of the common query patterns around this use case:</p>\n<ol><li>Get <em>Customer</em> info</li>\n<li>Get <em>Product</em> info</li>\n<li>Get all <em>Customers</em> who like a given <em>Product</em></li>\n<li>Get all <em>Products</em> a given <em>Customer</em> likes</li>\n</ol><p>We will start by using separate tables for storing the <em>Customer</em> and <em>Product</em> information. However, we need to introduce a fair amount of denormalization to support the 3rd and 4th queries shown above.</p>\n<p>We will create two more tables to achieve this – “<em>Customer_by_Product</em>” and “<em>Product_by_Customer</em>“.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at the Cassandra table schema for this example:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: sql; gutter: true\">CREATE TABLE Customer (&#13;\n  cust_id text,&#13;\n  first_name text, &#13;\n  last_name text,&#13;\n  registered_on timestamp, &#13;\n  PRIMARY KEY (cust_id));&#13;\n&#13;\nCREATE TABLE Product (&#13;\n  prdt_id text,&#13;\n  title text,&#13;\n  PRIMARY KEY (prdt_id));&#13;\n&#13;\nCREATE TABLE Customer_By_Liked_Product (&#13;\n  liked_prdt_id text,&#13;\n  liked_on timestamp,&#13;\n  title text,&#13;\n  cust_id text,&#13;\n  first_name text, &#13;\n  last_name text, &#13;\n  PRIMARY KEY (prdt_id, liked_on));&#13;\n&#13;\nCREATE TABLE Product_Liked_By_Customer (&#13;\n  cust_id text, &#13;\n  first_name text,&#13;\n  last_name text,&#13;\n  liked_prdt_id text, &#13;\n  liked_on timestamp,&#13;\n  title text,&#13;\n  PRIMARY KEY (cust_id, liked_on));</pre>\n<p>Note: To support both the queries, recently-liked products by a given customer and customers who recently liked a given product, we have used the “<em>liked_on</em>” column as a clustering key.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at the query to find the ten Customers who most recently liked the product “<em>Pepsi</em>“:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: sql; gutter: true\">SELECT * FROM Customer_By_Liked_Product WHERE title = \"Pepsi\" LIMIT 10</pre>\n<p>And let’s see the query that finds the recently-liked products (up to ten) by a customer named “<em>Anna</em>“:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: sql; gutter: true\">SELECT * FROM Product_Liked_By_Customer &#13;\n  WHERE first_name = \"Anna\" LIMIT 10</pre>\n<h2><strong>6. Inefficient Query Patterns</strong></h2>\n<p>Due to the way that Cassandra stores data, some query patterns are not at all efficient, including the following:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Fetching data from multiple partitions</strong> – this will require a coordinator to fetch the data from multiple nodes, store it temporarily in heap, and then aggregate the data before returning results to the user</li>\n<li><strong>Join-based queries</strong> – due to its distributed nature, Cassandra does not support table joins in queries the same way a relational database does, and as a result, <strong>queries with</strong> <strong>joins will be slower and can also lead to inconsistency and availability issues</strong></li>\n</ul><h2><strong>7. Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>In this tutorial, we have covered several best practices around how to approach data modeling in Cassandra.</p>\n<p>Understanding the core concepts and identifying the query patterns in advance is necessary for designing a correct data model that gets the best performance from a Cassandra cluster.</p>\n<div class=\"short_box short_end\">\n<h3><b>I just announced the new Spring 5 modules in REST With Spring: </b></h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.baeldung.com/rest-with-spring-course#new-modules\">&gt;&gt; CHECK OUT THE LESSONS</a></strong></p>\n</div>",

        "content": "<p>Although Cassandra query language resembles with<a href=\"https://www.guru99.com/sql.html\"> SQL </a>language, their data modelling methods are totally different. </p><p>In Cassandra, a bad data model can degrade performance, especially when users try to implement the RDBMS concepts on Cassandra. It is best to keep in mind few rules detailed below. </p><p>In this tutorial, you will learn- </p><ul><li><a href=\"#1\">Cassandra Data Model Rules</a></li> <li><a href=\"#2\">Model Your Data in Cassandra</a></li> <li><a href=\"#3\">Handling One to One Relationship</a></li> <li><a href=\"#4\">Handling one to many relationships</a></li> <li><a href=\"#5\">Handling Many to Many Relationship</a></li> </ul><h2>Cassandra Data Model Rules</h2><p>In Cassandra, writes are not expensive. Cassandra does not support joins, group by, OR clause, aggregations, etc. So you have to store your data in such a way that it should be completely retrievable. So these rules must be kept in mind while modelling data in Cassandra. </p><ol><li><strong>Maximize the number of writes</strong><p>In Cassandra, writes are very cheap. Cassandra is optimized for high write performance. So try to maximize your writes for better read performance and data availability. There is a tradeoff between data write and data read. So, optimize you data read performance by maximizing the number of data writes.</p></li> <li><strong>Maximize Data Duplication</strong><p>Data denormalization and data duplication are defacto of Cassandra. Disk space is not more expensive than memory, CPU processing and IOs operation. As Cassandra is a distributed database, so data duplication provides instant data availability and no single point of failure.</p></li> </ol><p><strong>Data Modeling Goals </strong> </p><p>You should have following goals while modelling data in Cassandra. </p><ol><li><strong>Spread Data Evenly Around the Cluster</strong><p>You want an equal amount of data on each node of Cassandra cluster. Data is spread to different nodes based on partition keys that is the first part of the primary key. So, try to choose integers as a primary key for spreading data evenly around the cluster.</p></li> <li><strong>Minimize number of partitions read while querying data</strong><p>Partition are a group of records with the same partition key. When the read query is issued, it collects data from different nodes from different partitions. </p><p>If there will be many partitions, then all these partitions need to be visited for collecting the query data. </p><p>It does not mean that partitions should not be created. If your data is very large, you can’t keep that huge amount of data on the single partition. The single partition will be slowed down. </p><p>So try to choose a balanced number of partitions. </p></li> </ol><p><strong>Good Primary Key</strong> </p><p>Let’s take an example and find which primary key is good. </p><p>Here is the table MusicPlaylist. </p><pre>&#13;\nCreate table MusicPlaylist&#13;\n    (&#13;\n        SongId int,&#13;\n        SongName text,&#13;\n        Year int,&#13;\n        Singer text,&#13;\n        Primary key(SongId, SongName)&#13;\n    );&#13;\n</pre><p>In above example, table MusicPlaylist, </p><ul><li>Songid is the partition key, and </li> <li>SongName is the clustering column</li> <li>Data will be clustered on the basis of SongName. Only one partition will be created with the SongId. There will not be any other partition in the table MusicPlaylist. </li> </ul><p>Data retrieval will be slow by this data model due to the bad primary key. </p><p>Here is another table MusicPlaylist. </p><pre>&#13;\nCreate table MusicPlaylist&#13;\n    (&#13;\n        SongId int,&#13;\n        SongName text,&#13;\n        Year int,&#13;\n        Singer text,&#13;\n        Primary key((SongId, Year), SongName)&#13;\n    );&#13;\n</pre><p>In above example, table MusicPlaylist, </p><ul><li>Songid and Year are the partition key, and </li> <li>SongName is the clustering column. </li> <li>Data will be clustered on the basis of SongName. In this table, each year, a new partition will be created. All the songs of the year will be on the same node. This primary key will be very useful for the data. </li> </ul><p>Our data retrieval will be fast by this data model. </p><h2>Model Your Data in Cassandra</h2><p>Following things should be kept in mind while modelling your queries. </p><ol><li><strong>Determine what queries you want to support</strong></li>             </ol><ul><li>Joins</li> <li>Group by</li> <li>Filtering on which column etc.</li> </ul><strong>Create table according to your queries</strong><p>Create table according to your queries. Create a table that will satisfy your queries. Try to create a table in such a way that a minimum number of partitions needs to be read.</p><h2>Handling One to One Relationship</h2><p>One to one relationship means two tables have one to one correspondence. For example, the student can register only one course, and I want to search on a student that in which course a particular student is registered in. </p><p>So in this case, your table schema should encompass all the details of the student in corresponding to that particular course like the name of the course, roll no of the student, student name, etc. </p><pre>&#13;\nCreate table Student_Course&#13;\n    (&#13;\n        Student rollno int primary key,&#13;\n        Student_name text,&#13;\n        Course_name text,&#13;\n    );&#13;\n</pre><h2>Handling one to many relationships</h2><p>One to many relationships means having one to many correspondence between two tables. </p><p>For example, a course can be studied by many students. I want to search all the students that are studying a particular course. </p><p>So by querying on course name, I will have many student names that will be studying a particular course. </p><pre>&#13;\nCreate table Student_Course&#13;\n    (&#13;\n        Student_rollno int,&#13;\n        Student_name text,&#13;\n        Course_name text,&#13;\n    );&#13;\n</pre><p>I can retrieve all the students for a particular course by the following query. </p><pre>&#13;\nSelect * from Student_Course where Course_name='Course Name';&#13;\n</pre><h2>Handling Many to Many Relationship</h2><p>Many to many relationships means having many to many correspondence between two tables. </p><p>For example, a course can be studied by many students, and a student can also study many courses. </p><p>I want to search all the students that are studying a particular course. Also, I want to search all the course that a particular student is studying. </p><p>So in this case, I will have two tables i.e. divide the problem into two cases. </p><p>First, I will create a table by which you can find courses by a particular student. </p><pre>&#13;\nCreate table Student_Course&#13;\n    (&#13;\n        Student_rollno int primary key,&#13;\n        Student_name text,&#13;\n        Course_name text,&#13;\n    );&#13;\n</pre><p>I can find all the courses by a particular student by the following query. </p><pre>&#13;\nSelect * from Student_Course where student_rollno=rollno;&#13;\n</pre><p>Second, I will create a table by which you can find how many students are studying a particular course. </p><pre>&#13;\nCreate table Course_Student&#13;\n    (&#13;\n        Course_name text primary key,&#13;\n        Student_name text,&#13;\n        student_rollno int&#13;\n    );&#13;\n</pre><p>I can find a student in a particular course by the following query. </p><pre>&#13;\nSelect * from Course_Student where Course_name=CourseName;&#13;\n</pre><p><strong>Difference between RDBMS and Cassandra Data Modelling</strong></p><table class=\"table table-striped\"><tr><td><p><strong>RDBMS</strong> </p></td><td><p><strong>Cassandra</strong> </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Stores data in normalized form </p></td><td><p>Stores data in denormalized form </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Legacy dbms; structured data </p></td><td><p>Wide row store,Dynamic; structured &amp; unstructured data </p></td></tr></table><p><strong>Summary</strong> </p><p>Data modelling in Cassandra is different than other RDBMS databases. Cassandra data modelling has some rules. These rules must be followed for good data modelling. Besides these rules, we saw three different data modelling cases and how to deal with them. </p><p id=\"slidetag\"> </p>",

        "content": "<div class=\"content-html\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>In this post, we are going to discuss the different keys available in Cassandra. The primary key concept in Cassandra is different from relational databases. Therefore, it is worth spending some time to understand it.</p>\n<p>Let's take an example and create a student table which has <code>student_id</code> as a primary key column.</p>\n<h2><strong>1) Primary Key </strong></h2>\n<pre lang=\"text/x-cassandra\">create table person (student_id int primary key, fname text, lname text, \n                     dateofbirth timestamp, email text, phone text );</pre>\n<p>In Cassandra, a table can have a number of rows. Each row is referenced by a primary key, also called the row key. There are a number of columns in a row but the number of columns can vary in different rows.</p>\n<p>For example, one row in a table can have three columns whereas another row in the same table can have 10 columns. It is also important to note that in Cassandra, both column names and values have binary types. That means column names can have binary values, such as strings, timestamps, or an integer, etc. This is different from SQL databases, where each row in a SQL table has a fixed number of columns, and column names can only be text.</p>\n<p>We saw that <code>student_id</code> was used as a row key to refer to <code>person</code> data.</p>\n<h2><strong>2) Compound Primary Key</strong></h2>\n<p>As the name suggests, a compound primary key is comprised of one or more columns that are referenced in the primary key. One component of the compound primary key is called partition key, whereas the other component is called the clustering key. The following are different variations of primary keys. Please note that C1, C2, C3,… and so on represent columns in the table.</p>\n<ul><li><p><strong>C1</strong>: Primary key has only one partition key and no cluster key.</p></li>\n <li><p><strong>(C1, C2)</strong>: Column C1 is a partition key and column C2 is a cluster key.</p></li>\n <li><p><strong>(C1,C2,C3,…)</strong>: Column C1 is a partition key and columns C2, C3, and so on make the cluster key.</p></li>\n <li><p><strong>(C1, (C2, C3,…))</strong>: It is same as 3, i.e., column C1 is a partition key and columns C2,C3,… make the cluster key.</p></li>\n <li><p><strong>((C1, C2,…), (C3,C4,…))</strong>: columns C1, C2 make partition key and columns C3,C4,… make the cluster key.</p></li>\n</ul><p>It is important to note that when the compound key is C1, C2, C3, then the first key, C1, becomes the partition key, and the rest of the keys become part of the cluster key. In order to make composite partition keys, we have to specify keys in parenthesis such as: ( ( C1,C2) , C3, C4). In this case, C1 and C2 are part of the partition keys, and C3 and C4 are part of the cluster key.</p>\n<h2><strong>3) Partition Key</strong></h2>\n<p>The purpose of a partition key is to identify the partition or node in the cluster that stores that row. When data is read or written from the cluster, a function called Partitioner is used to compute the hash value of the partition key. This hash value is used to determine the node/partition which contains that row. For example, rows whose partition key values range from 1000 to 1234 may reside in node A, and rows with partition key values range from 1235 to 2000 may reside in node B, as shown in figure 1. If a row contains partition key whose hash value is 1233 then it will be stored in node A.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"cluster\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-20848 fr-fin fr-dib\" src=\"https://knoldus.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/cluster.gif?w=640\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>4) Clustering Key</strong></h2>\n<p>The purpose of the clustering key is to store row data in a sorted order. The sorting of data is based on columns, which are included in the clustering key. This arrangement makes it efficient to retrieve data using the clustering key.</p>\n<h2><strong>Example</strong></h2>\n<p>To make these concepts clear, we will consider the example of a school system.</p>\n<p>Create a keyspace with replication strategy ‘SimpleStrategy’ and replication_factor 1.</p>\n<pre lang=\"text/x-cassandra\">create keyspace Students_Details with replication = {‘class’ : ‘SimpleStrategy’, ‘replication_factor’:1};</pre>\n<p>Now switch to the students_details keyspace:</p>\n<pre lang=\"text/x-cassandra\">use students_details;\n</pre>\n<p>Check the number of tables present in the keyspace:</p>\n<pre lang=\"text/x-cassandra\">students_details&gt; desc TABLES;</pre>\n<p>We will create a table, <code>student</code> , that contains general information about any student.</p>\n<pre lang=\"text/x-cassandra\">create table student (stuid int, avg_marks float, description text, \n                      primary key (stuid));</pre>\n<p>Type the following insert statements to enter some data into this table.</p>\n<pre lang=\"text/x-cassandra\">insert into student (stuid, avg_marks, description) values (1,25.5,’student 1′);\ninsert into student (stuid, avg_marks, description) values (2,35.5,’student 2′);</pre>\n<p>To view the details just inserted...</p>\n<pre lang=\"text/x-cassandra\">students_details&gt; select * from student;</pre>\n<pre lang=\"text/x-sh\">stuid | avg_marks | description\n——-+———–+————-\n1 |      25.5 |   student 1\n2 |      35.5 |   student 2</pre>\n<p>We can see how Cassandra has stored this data under the hood by using the <code>cassandra-cli</code> tool. Run <code>cassandra-cli</code> in a separate terminal windo.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: The CLI utility is deprecated and will be removed in Cassandra 3.0. For ease of use and performance, switch from Thrift and CLI to CQL and cqlsh.)</p>\n<p>So if you're using a Cassandra verison above 3.0, then use the below commands.</p>\n<p>Using the <strong>EXPAND</strong> Command in cqlsh , we can view the details info for the queries . EXPAND with no arguments shows the current value of the expanded setting.</p>\n<p><code>cqlsh:students_details&gt; EXPAND</code> </p>\n<p>If expanded output is disabled. Use <code>EXPAND ON</code> to enable it.</p>\n<p>Now view the details inserted above (the studid will be present in a red color in cqlsh, representing the primary key/row key)</p>\n<p><code>cqlsh:students_details&gt; select * from student;</code></p>\n<pre lang=\"text/x-cassandra\">@ Row 1\n————-+———–\nstuid       | 1\navg_marks   | 25.5\ndescription | student 1\n@ Row 2\n————-+———–\nstuid       | 2\navg_marks   | 35.5\ndescription | student 2\n(2 rows)</pre>\n<p>We can see from the above output that the stuid has become the row key, and it identifies individual rows.</p>\n<p><code>cqlsh:students_details&gt; select token(stuid) from student;</code></p>\n<pre lang=\"text/x-sh\">@ Row 1\n———————+———————-\nsystem.token(stuid) | -4069959284402364209\n@ Row 2\n———————+———————-\nsystem.token(stuid) | -3248873570005575792</pre>\n<p>Also, you can see that there are two tokens.</p>\n<p>We can use columns in the primary key to filter data in the select statement. Type the following command in the cqlsh window:</p>\n<p><code>select * from student where stuid = 1;</code> </p>\n<p>Now we will create another table called marks, which records marks of each student every day (say every day, new exams and marks are recorded). Type the following command on cqlsh:</p>\n<pre lang=\"text/x-cassandra\">create table marks(stuid int,exam_date timestamp,marks float, exam_name text, \n                   primary key (stuid,exam_date));</pre>\n<p>This statement creates the marks table with a primary key (stuid , exam_date ). As the primary key has two components, the first component is considered a partition key, and the second component becomes the cluster key. Add some data into the table:</p>\n<pre lang=\"text/x-cassandra\">insert into marks(stuid ,exam_date ,marks ,exam_name) values (1,’2016-11-10′,76 ,’examA’);\ninsert into marks(stuid ,exam_date ,marks ,exam_name) values (1,’2016-11-11′,90 ,’examB’);\ninsert into marks(stuid ,exam_date ,marks ,exam_name) values (1,’2016-11-12′,68 ,’examC’);</pre>\n<p><code>cqlsh:students_details&gt; select * from marks;</code></p>\n<pre lang=\"text/x-cassandra\">@ Row 1\n———–+————————–\nstuid     | 1\nexam_date | 2016-11-09 18:30:00+0000\nexam_name | examA\nmarks     | 76\n@ Row 2\n———–+————————–\nstuid     | 1\nexam_date | 2016-11-10 18:30:00+0000\nexam_name | examB\nmarks     | 90\n@ Row 3\n———–+————————–\nstuid     | 1\nexam_date | 2016-11-11 18:30:00+0000\nexam_name | examC\nmarks     | 68</pre>\n<p>Now, let's see how the partition concept has been applied:</p>\n<p><code>cqlsh:students_details&gt; select token(stuid) from marks;</code></p>\n<pre lang=\"text/x-cassandra\">@ Row 1\n———————+———————-\nsystem.token(stuid) | -4069959284402364209\n@ Row 2\n———————+———————-\nsystem.token(stuid) | -4069959284402364209\n@ Row 3\n———————+———————-\nsystem.token(stuid) | -4069959284402364209</pre>\n<p>We can see all the three rows have the <strong>same partition token</strong>, hence Cassandra stores only one row for each partition key. All the data associated with that partition key is stored as columns in the datastore. The data that we have stored through three different insert statements have the same stuid value, i.e. 1, therefore, all the data is saved in that row as columns, i.e under one partition.</p>\n<p>If you remember, we discussed before that the second component of a primary key is called the clustering key. The role of the clustering key is to group related items together. All the data that is inserted against same clustering key is grouped together.</p>\n<p>In this case, all the columns, such as <strong>exam_name </strong>and<strong> marks</strong>, will be grouped by value in <strong>exam</strong>_<strong>date</strong>, i.e 2016-11-11 18:30:00+0000, by default in ascending order .</p>\n<p>I hope these examples have helped you to clarify some of the concepts of data modeling in Cassandra.

        "content": "<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/\">first part</a>, we covered a few fundamental practices and walked through a detailed example to help you get started with Cassandra data model design. You can follow Part 2 without reading Part 1, but I recommend glancing over the <a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/\">terms and conventions</a> I’m using. If you’re new to Cassandra, I urge you to read <a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/\">Part 1</a>.</p><p>September 2014 Update: Readers should note that this article describes data modeling techniques based on Cassandra’s Thrift API.  Please see <a href=\"https://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/DataModel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/DataModel</a> for CQL API based techniques.</p><p>August 2015 Update:  Readers can also sign up a free online self-paced course on how to model their data in Apache Cassandra from <a href=\"https://academy.datastax.com/courses/ds220-data-modeling?dxt=blogposting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://academy.datastax.com/courses/ds220-data-modeling?dxt=blogposting</a>.</p><p>Some of the practices listed below might evolve in the future. I’ve provided related JIRA ticket numbers so you can watch any evolution.</p><p>With that, let’s get started with some basic practices!</p><h3>Storing values in column names is perfectly OK</h3><p><em>Leaving column values empty (“valueless” columns) is also OK.</em></p><p>It’s a common practice with Cassandra to store a value (actual data) in the column name (a.k.a. column key), and even to leave the column value field empty if there is nothing else to store. One motivation for this practice is that column names are stored physically sorted, but column values are not.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>The maximum column key (and row key) size is 64KB.  However, don’t store something like ‘item description’ as the column key!</li>\n<li>Don’t use timestamp alone as a column key. You might get colliding timestamps from two or more app servers writing to Cassandra. Prefer timeuuid (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">type-1 uuid</a>) instead.</li>\n<li>The maximum column value size is 2 GB. But becuase there is no streaming and the whole value is fetched in heap memory when requested, limit the size to only a few MBs.  (Large objects are not likely to be supported in the near future – <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-265\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cassandra-265</a>. However, the <a href=\"https://github.com/Netflix/astyanax/wiki/Chunked-Object-Store\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Astyanax</a> client library supports large objects by chunking them.)</li>\n</ul><h3>Leverage wide rows for ordering, grouping, and filtering</h3><p><em>But don’t go too wide.</em></p><p>This goes along with the above practice. When actual data is stored in column names, we end up with wide rows.</p><p><strong>Benefits of wide rows:</strong></p><ul><li>Since column names are stored physically sorted, wide rows enable ordering of data and hence efficient filtering (range scans). You’ll still be able to efficiently look up an individual column within a wide row, if needed.</li>\n<li>If data is queried together, you can group that data up in a single wide row that can be read back efficiently, as part of a single query. As an example, for tracking or monitoring some time series data, we can group data by hour/date/machines/event types (depending on the requirements)  in a single wide row, with each column containing granular data or roll-ups. We can also further group data within a row using super or composite columns as discussed later.</li>\n<li>Wide row column families are heavily used (with composite columns) to build custom indexes in Cassandra.</li>\n<li>As a side benefit, you can de-normalize a one-to-many relationship as a wide row without data duplication. However, I would do this only when data is queried together and you need to optimize read performance.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p>Let’s say we want to store some event log data and retrieve that data hourly. As shown in the model below, the row key is the hour of the day, the column name holds the time when the event occurred, and the column value contains payload. Note that the row is wide and the events are ordered by time because column names are stored sorted. Granularity of the wide row (for this example, per hour rather than every few minutes) depends on the use case, traffic, and data size, as discussed next.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/08/widerow.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-2/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/08/_resampled/ResizedImageWzM4OCwxMzFd/widerow.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"388\" height=\"131\" title=\"\" /></a></p><h3>But not too wide, as a row is never split across nodes:</h3><p>It’s hard to say exactly how wide a wide row should be, partly because it’s dependent upon the use case. But here’s some advice:</p><p><strong>Traffic</strong>: All of the traffic related to one row is handled by only one node/shard (by a single set of replicas, to be more precise). Rows that are too “fat” could cause hot spots in the cluster – usually when the number of rows is smaller than the size of the cluster (hope not!), or when wide rows are mixed with skinny ones, or some rows become hotter than others. However, cluster load balancing ultimately depends on the row key selection; conversely, the row key also defines how wide a row will be. So load balancing is something to keep in mind during design.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>: As a row is not split across nodes, data for a single row must fit on disk within a single node in the cluster. However, rows can be large enough that they don’t have to fit in memory entirely. Cassandra allows 2 billion columns per row. At eBay, we’ve not done any “wide row” benchmarking, but we model data such that we never hit more than a few million columns or a few megabytes in one row (we change the row key granularity, or we split into multiple rows). If you’re interested, <a href=\"http://thelastpickle.com/2011/07/04/Cassandra-Query-Plans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cassandra Query Plans</a> by Aaron Morton shows some performance concerns with wide rows (but note that the results can change in new releases).</p><p>However, these caveats don’t mean you should not use wide rows; just don’t go extra wide.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <a id=\"key-val\" href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-4176\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cassandra-4176</a> might add composite types for row key in CQL as a way to split a wide row into multiple rows. However, a single (physical) row is never split <em>across nodes</em> (and won’t be split across nodes in the future), and is always handled by a single set of replicas. You might also want to track <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-3929\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cassandra-3929,</a> which would add row size limits for keeping the most recent <em>n</em> columns in a wide row.</p><h3><strong>Choose the proper row key – it’s your “shard key” </strong></h3><p><em>Otherwise, you’ll end up with hot spots, even with <a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/docs/0.8/cluster_architecture/partitioning#about-the-random-partitioner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RandomPartitioner</a>.</em></p><p>Let’s consider again the above example of storing time series event logs and retrieving them hourly. We picked the hour of the day as the row key to keep one hour of data together in a row. But there is an issue: All of the writes will go only to the node holding the row for the current hour, causing a hot spot in the cluster. Reducing granularity from hour to minutes won’t help much, because only one node will be responsible for handling writes for whatever duration you pick. As time moves, the hot spot might also move but it won’t go away!</p><p><strong>Bad row key:  </strong>“ddmmyyhh”</p><p>One way to alleviate this problem is to add something else to the row key – an event type, machine id, or similar value that’s appropriate to your use case.</p><p><strong>Better row key: </strong>“ddmmyyhh|eventtype”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/08/shardkey.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-2/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/08/_resampled/ResizedImageWzQ2NiwxMjhd/shardkey.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"466\" height=\"128\" title=\"\" /></a></p><p>Note that now we don’t have global time ordering of events, across all event types, in the column family. However, this may be OK if the data is viewed (grouped) by event type later. If the use case also demands retrieving all of the events (irrespective of type) in time sequence, we need to do a multi-get for all event types for a given time period, and honor the time order when merging the data in the application.</p><p>If you can’t add anything to the row key or if you absolutely need ‘time period’ as a row key, another option is to shard a row into multiple (physical) rows by manually splitting row keys: “ddmmyyhh | 1”, “ddmmyyhh | 2”,… “ddmmyyhh | n”, where <em>n</em> is the number of nodes in the cluster. For an hour window, each shard will now evenly handle the writes; you need to round-robin among them. But reading data for an hour will require multi-gets from all of the splits (from the multiple physical nodes) and merging them in the application. (An assumption here is that RandomPartitioner is used, and therefore that range scans on row keys can’t be done.)</p><h3><strong>Keep read-heavy data separate from write-heavy data<br /></strong></h3><p><em>This way, you can benefit from Cassandra’s off-heap row cache.</em></p><p>Irrespective of caching and even outside the NoSQL world, it’s always a good practice to keep read-heavy and write-heavy data separate because they scale differently.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>A row cache is useful for skinny rows, but harmful for wide rows today because it pulls the entire row into memory. <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-1956\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cassandra-1956</a> and <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-2864\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cassandra-2864</a> might change this in future releases. However, the practice of keeping read-heavy data separate from write-heavy data will still stand.</li>\n<li>Even if you have lots of data (more than available memory) in a column family but you also have particularly “hot” rows, enabling a row cache might be useful.</li>\n</ul><h3>Make sure column key and row key are unique</h3><p><em>Otherwise, data could get accidentally overwritten.</em></p><ul><li>In Cassandra (a distributed database!), there is no unique constraint enforcement for row key or column key.</li>\n<li>Also, there is no separate update operation (no in-place updates!). It’s always an upsert (mutate) in Cassandra. If you accidentally insert data with an existing row key and column key, the previous column value will be silently overwritten without any error (the change won’t be versioned; the data will be gone).</li>\n</ul><h3>Use the proper comparator and validator</h3><p><em>Don’t just use the default BytesType comparator and validator unless you really need to.</em></p><p>In Cassandra, the data type for a column <em><strong>value </strong></em>(or row key)  is called a <em>Validator</em>. The data type for a column <em><strong>name</strong></em> is called a <em>Comparator</em>.  Although Cassandra does not require you to define both, you must at least specify the comparator unless your column family is static (that is, you’re not storing actual data as part of the column name), or unless you really don’t care about the sort order.</p><ul><li>An improper comparator will sort column names inappropriately on the disk. It will be difficult (or impossible) to do range scans on column names later.</li>\n<li>Once defined, you can’t change a comparator without rewriting all data. However, the validator can be changed later.</li>\n</ul><p>See <a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/docs/1.0/ddl/column_family#about-data-types-comparators-and-validators\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">comparators and validators</a> in the Cassandra documentation for the supported data types.</p><h3>Keep the column name short</h3><p><em>Because it’s stored <em>repeatedly.</em><br /></em></p><p>This practice doesn’t apply if you use the column name to store actual data. Otherwise, keep the column name short, since it’s repeatedly stored with each column value. Memory and storage overhead can be significant when the size of the column value is not much larger than the size of the column name – or worse, when it’s smaller.</p><p>For example, favor ‘fname’ over ‘firstname’, and ‘lname’ over ‘lastname’.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-4175\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cassandra-4175</a> might make this practice obsolete in the future.</p><h3>Design the data model such that operations are idempotent</h3><p><em>Or, make sure that your use case can live with inaccuracies or that inaccuracies can be corrected eventually.</em></p><p>In an eventually consistent and fully distributed system like Cassandra, idempotent operations can help – a lot. Idempotent operations allow partial failures in the system, as the operations can be retried safely without changing the final state of the system. In addition, idempotency can sometimes alleviate the need for strong consistency and allow you to work with eventual consistency without causing data duplication or other anomalies. Let’s see how these principles apply in Cassandra. I’ll discuss partial failures only, and leave out alleviating the need for strong consistency until an upcoming post, as it is very much dependent on the use case.</p><p>Because of  Cassandra’s fully distributed (and multi-master) nature, write failure does not guarantee that data is not written, unlike the behavior of relational databases. In other words, even if the client receives a failure for a write operation, data might be written to one of the replicas, which will eventually get propagated to all replicas. No rollback or cleanup is performed on partially written data. Thus, a perceived write failure can result in a successful write eventually. So, retries on write failure can yield unexpected results if your model isn’t update idempotent.</p><p><strong>Notes: </strong></p><ul><li>“Update idempotent” here means a model where operations are idempotent. An operation is called idempotent if it can be applied one time or multiple times with the same result.</li>\n<li>In most cases, idempotency won’t be a concern, as writes into regular column families are always update idempotent. The exception is with the Counter column family, as shown in the example below. However, sometimes your use case can model data such that write operations are not update idempotent from the use case perspective. For instance, in <a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/\">part 1</a>, User_by_Item and Item_by_User in the final model are not update idempotent if the use case operation ‘user likes item’ gets executed multiple times, as the timestamp might differ for each like. However, note that a specific instance of  the use case operation ‘user likes item’ is still idempotent, and so can be retried multiple times in case of failures. As this is more use-case specific, I might elaborate more in future posts.</li>\n<li>Even with a consistency level ONE, write failure does not guarantee data is not written; the data still could get propagated to all replicas eventually.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Example</strong></p><p>Suppose that we want to count the number of users who like a particular item. One way is to use the <a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/whats-new-in-cassandra-0-8-part-2-counters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Counter</a> column family supported by Cassandra to keep count of users per item. Since the counter increment (or decrement) is not update idempotent, retry on failure could yield an over-count if the previous increment was successful on at least one node. One way to make the model update idempotent is to maintain a list of user ids instead of incrementing a count, as shown below. Whenever a user likes an item, we write that user’s id against the item; if the write fails, we can safely retry. To determine the count of all users who like an item, we read all user ids for the item and count manually.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/08/idempotency2.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-2/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/08/_resampled/ResizedImageWzU4MiwxNTld/idempotency2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"582\" height=\"159\" title=\"\" /></a></p><p>In the above update idempotent model, getting the counter value requires reading all user ids, which will not perform well (there could be millions). If reads are heavy on the counter and you can live with an approximate count, the counter column will be efficient for this use case. If needed, the counter value can be corrected periodically by counting the user ids from the update idempotent column family.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-2495\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cassandra-2495</a> might add a proper retry mechanism for counters in the case of a failed request. However, in general, this practice will continue to hold true. So make sure to always litmus-test your model for update idempotency.</p><h3><strong>Model data around transactions, if needed</strong></h3><p><em>But this might not always be possible, depending on the use case.</em></p><p>Cassandra has no multi-row, cluster-wide transaction or rollback mechanism; instead, it offers row-level atomicity. In other words, a single mutation operation of columns for a given row key is atomic. So if you need transactional behavior, try to model your data such that you would only ever need to update a single row at once. However, depending on the use case, this is not always doable. Also, if your system needs ACID transactions, you might re-think your database choice.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-4285\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cassandra-4285</a> might add an atomic, eventually consistent batch operation.</p><h3>Decide on the proper TTL up front, if you can<br /></h3><p><em>Because it’s hard to change TTL for existing data.</em></p><p>In Cassandra, TTL (time to live) is not defined or set at the column family level. It’s set per column value, and once set it’s hard to change; or, if not set, it’s hard to set for existing data. The only way to change the TTL for existing data is to read and re-insert all the data with a new TTL value. So think about your purging requirements, and if possible set the proper TTL for your data upfront.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-3974\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cassandra-3974</a> might introduce TTL for the column family, separate from column TTL.</p><h3>Don’t use the Counter column family to generate surrogate keys<br /></h3><p><em>Because it’s not intended for this purpose.<br /></em></p><p>The Counter column family holds distributed counters meant (of course) for distributed counting. Don’t try to use this CF to generate sequence numbers for surrogate keys, like Oracle sequences or MySQL auto-increment columns. You will receive duplicate sequence numbers! Most of the time you really don’t need globally sequential numbers. Prefer timeuuid (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">type-1 uuid</a>) as surrogate keys. If you truly need a globally sequential number generator, there are a few possible mechanisms; but all will require centralized coordination, and thus can impact the overall system’s scalability and availability.</p><h3>Favor composite columns over super columns</h3><p><em>Otherwise, you might hit performance bottlenecks with super columns.</em></p><p>A super column in Cassandra can be used to group column keys, or to model a two-layer hierarchy. However, super columns have the following implementation issues and are therefore becoming less favorable.</p><p><strong>Issues:</strong></p><ul><li>Sub-columns of a super column are not indexed. Reading one sub-column de-serializes all sub-columns.</li>\n<li>Built-in secondary indexing does not work with sub-columns.</li>\n<li>Super columns cannot encode more than two layers of hierarchy.</li>\n</ul><p>Similar (even better) functionality can be achieved by the use of the Composite column. It’s a regular column with sub-columns encoded in it. Hence, all of the benefits of regular columns, such as sorting and range scans, are available; and you can encode more than two layers of hierarchy.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-3237\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cassandra-3237</a> might change the underlying super column implementation to use composite columns. However, composite columns will still remain preferred over super columns.</p><h3>The order of sub-columns in composite columns matters</h3><p><em>Because order defines grouping.</em></p><p>For example, a composite column key like &lt;state|city&gt; will be stored ordered first by state and then by city, rather than first by city and then by state. In other words, all the cities within a state are located (grouped) on disk together.</p><h3>Favor built-in composite types over manual construction</h3><p><em>Because manual construction doesn’t always work.</em></p><p>Avoid manually constructing the composite column keys using string concatenation (with separators like “:” or “|”). Instead, use the built-in composite types (and comparators) supported by Cassandra 0.8.1 and above.</p><p><strong>Why?</strong></p><ul><li>Manual construction won’t work if sub-columns are of different data types. For example, the composite key &lt;state|zip|timeuuid&gt; will not be sorted in a type-aware fashion (state as string, zip code as integer, and timeuuid as time).</li>\n<li>You can’t reverse the sort order on components in the type – for instance, with the state ascending and the zip code descending in the above key.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> Cassandra built-in composite types come in two flavors:</p><ul><li><em>Static composite type: </em>Data types for each part of a composite column are predefined per column family.  All the column names/keys within a column family must be of that composite type.</li>\n<li><em>Dynamic composite type: </em>This type allows mixing column names with different composite types in a column family or even in one row.</li>\n</ul><p>Find more information about composite types at <a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/introduction-to-composite-columns-part-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Introduction to composite columns</a>.</p><h3>Favor static composite types over dynamic, whenever possible</h3><p><em>Because dynamic composites are too dynamic.</em></p><p>If all column keys in a column family are of the same composite type, always use static composite types. Dynamic composite types were originally created to keep multiple custom indexes in one column family. If possible, don’t mix different composite types in one row using the dynamic composite type unless absolutely required. <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-3625\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cassandra-3625</a> has fixed some serious issues with dynamic composites.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> CQL 3 supports static composite types for column names via clustered (wide) rows. Find more information about how CQL 3 handles wide rows at <a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/docs/1.1/ddl/column_family#composite-columns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DataStax docs</a>.</p><p>Enough for now. I would appreciate your inputs to further enhance these modeling best practices, which guide our Cassandra utilization today.</p><p>—  <a title=\"About me\" href=\"http://www.jaykumarpatel.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jay Patel</a>, architect@eBay.</p>",

        "content": "<p>This is the first in a series of posts on Cassandra data modeling, implementation, operations, and related practices that guide our Cassandra utilization at eBay. Some of these best practices we’ve learned from public forums, many are new to us, and a few still are arguable and could benefit from further experience.</p><p>September 2014 Update: Readers should note that this article describes data modeling techniques based on Cassandra’s Thrift API.  Please see <a href=\"https://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/DataModel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/DataModel</a> for CQL API based techniques.</p><p>August 2015 Update:  Readers can also sign up a free online self-paced course on how to model their data in Apache Cassandra from <a href=\"https://academy.datastax.com/courses/ds220-data-modeling?dxt=blogposting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://academy.datastax.com/courses/ds220-data-modeling?dxt=blogposting</a>.</p><p>In this part, I’ll cover a few basic practices and walk through a detailed example. Even if you don’t know anything about Cassandra, you should be able to follow almost everything.</p><h3>A few words on Cassandra @ eBay</h3><p>We’ve been trying out Cassandra for more than a year. Cassandra is now serving a handful of use cases ranging from write-heavy logging and tracking, to mixed workload. One of them serves our “Social Signal” project, which enables like/own/want features on eBay product pages. A few use cases have reached production, while more are in development.</p><p>Our Cassandra deployment is not huge, but it’s growing at a healthy pace. In the past couple of months, we’ve deployed dozens of nodes across several small clusters spanning multiple data centers. You may ask, why multiple clusters? We isolate clusters by functional area and criticality. Use cases with similar criticality from the same functional area share the same cluster, but reside in different keyspaces.</p><p>RedLaser, Hunch, and other eBay adjacencies are also trying out Cassandra for various purposes. In addition to Cassandra, we also utilize MongoDB and HBase. I won’t discuss these now, but suffice it to say we believe each has its own merit.</p><p>I’m sure you have more questions at this point. But I won’t tell you the full story yet. At the upcoming <a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/events/cassandrasummit2012\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cassandra summit</a>, I’ll go into detail about each use case, the data model, multi-datacenter deployment, lessons learned, and more.</p><p>The focus of this post is Cassandra data modeling best practices that we follow at eBay. So, let’s jump in with a few notes about terminology and representations I’ll be using for each post in this series.</p><h3>Terms and Conventions</h3><ul><li>The terms “Column Name” and “Column Key” are used interchangeably. Similarly, “Super Column Name” and “Super Column Key” are used interchangeably.</li>\n<li>The following layout represents a row in a Column Family (CF):<a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/07/term1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/07/_resampled/ResizedImageWzU2MSwxMjBd/term1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"561\" height=\"120\" title=\"\" /></a></li>\n</ul><ul><li>The following layout represents a row in a Super Column Family (SCF):<a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/07/term2.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/07/term2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"561\" title=\"\" /></a></li>\n</ul><ul><li>The following layout represents a row in a Column Family with composite columns. Parts of a composite column are separated by ‘|’. Note that this is just a representation convention; Cassandra’s built-in composite type encodes differently, not using ‘|’. (BTW, this post doesn’t require you to have detailed knowledge of super columns and composite columns.)<img src=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/07/term3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"561\" title=\"\" /></li>\n</ul><p>With that, let’s start with the first practice!</p><h3>Don’t think of a relational table<br /></h3><p><em>Instead, think of a nested, sorted map data structure.</em></p><p>The following relational model analogy is often used to introduce Cassandra to newcomers:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/07/analogy.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/07/_resampled/ResizedImageWzUwNCwxNjVd/analogy.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"504\" height=\"165\" title=\"\" /></a></p><p>This analogy helps make the transition from the relational to non-relational world. But don’t use this analogy while designing Cassandra column families. Instead, think of the Cassandra column family as a map of a map: an outer map keyed by a row key, and an inner map keyed by a column key. Both maps are sorted.</p><p><em> <em>SortedMap&lt;RowKey, SortedMap&lt;ColumnKey, ColumnValue&gt;&gt;</em> </em></p><p><strong>Why?</strong></p><p>A nested sorted map is a more accurate analogy than a relational table, and will help you make the right decisions about your Cassandra data model.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/07/thinkmap.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/07/_resampled/ResizedImageWzUyMSwxNTRd/thinkmap.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"521\" height=\"154\" title=\"\" /></a></p><p><strong>How?</strong></p><ul><li>A map gives efficient key lookup, and the sorted nature gives efficient scans. In Cassandra, we can use row keys and column keys to do efficient lookups and range scans.</li>\n<li>The number of column keys is unbounded. In other words, you can have wide rows.</li>\n<li>A key can itself hold a value. In other words, you can have a valueless column.</li>\n</ul><p>Range scan on row keys is possible only when data is partitioned in a cluster using <a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/docs/1.1/cluster_architecture/partitioning#about-ordered-partitioners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Order Preserving Partitioner (OOP)</a>. OOP is almost never used. So, you can think of the outer map as unsorted:<em><br /></em></p><p><em> <em>Map&lt;RowKey, SortedMap&lt;ColumnKey, ColumnValue&gt;&gt;</em> </em></p><p>As mentioned earlier, there is something called a “Super Column” in Cassandra. Think of this as a grouping of columns, which turns our two nested maps into three nested maps as follows:</p><p><em> <em>Map&lt;RowKey, SortedMap&lt;SuperColumnKey, SortedMap&lt;ColumnKey, ColumnValue&gt;&gt;&gt;</em> </em></p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>You need to pass the timestamp with each column value, for Cassandra to use internally for conflict resolution. However, the timestamp can be safely ignored during modeling. Also, do not plan to use timestamps as data in your application. They’re not for you, and they do not define new versions of your data (unlike in HBase).</li>\n<li>The Cassandra community has heavily criticized the implementation of Super Column because of performance concerns and the lack of support for secondary indexes. The same “super column like” functionality (or even better) can be achieved by using composite columns.</li>\n</ul><h3>Model column families around query patterns</h3><p><em>But start your design with entities and relationships, if you can.<br /></em></p><ul><li>Unlike in relational databases, it’s not easy to tune or introduce new query patterns in Cassandra by simply creating secondary indexes or building complex SQLs (using joins, order by, group by?) because of its high-scale distributed nature. So think about query patterns up front, and design column families accordingly.</li>\n<li>Remember the lesson of the nested sorted map, and think how you can organize data into that map to satisfy your query requirements of fast look-up/ordering/grouping/filtering/aggregation/etc.</li>\n</ul><p>However, entities and their relationships still matter (unless the use case is special – perhaps storing logs or other time series data?). What if I gave you query patterns to create a Cassandra model for an e-commerce website, but didn’t tell you anything about the entities and relationships? You might try to figure out entities and relationships, knowingly or unknowingly, from the query patterns or from your prior understanding of the domain (because entities and relationships are how we perceive the real world). It’s important to understand and start with entities and relationships, then continue modeling around query patterns by de-normalizing and duplicating. If this sounds confusing, make sure to go through the detailed example later in this post.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> It also helps to identify the most frequent query patterns and isolate the less frequent. Some queries might be executed only a few thousand times, while others a billion times. Also consider which queries are sensitive to latency and which are not. Make sure your model first satisfies the most frequent and critical queries.</p><h3>De-normalize and duplicate for read performance</h3><p><em>But don’t de-normalize if you don’t need to. It’s all about finding the right balance.<br /></em></p><p>In the relational world, the pros of normalization are well understood: less data duplication, fewer data modification anomalies, conceptually cleaner, easier to maintain, and so on. The cons are also understood: that queries might perform slowly if many tables are joined, etc. The same holds true in Cassandra, but the cons are magnified since it’s distributed and of course there are no joins (since it’s high-scale distributed!). So with a fully normalized schema, reads may perform much worse.</p><p>This and the previous practice (modeling around query patterns) are so important that I would like to further elaborate by devoting the rest of the post to a detailed example.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The example discussed below is just for demonstration purposes, and does not represent the data model used for Cassandra projects within eBay.</p><h3>Example: ‘Like’ relationship between User &amp; Item</h3><p>This example concerns the functionality of an e-commerce system where users can like one or more items. One user can like multiple items and one item can be liked by multiple users, leading to a many-to-many relationship as shown in the relational model below:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/07/relational.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/07/_resampled/ResizedImageWzU5MCwzNDld/relational.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"349\" title=\"\" /></a></p><p>For this example, let’s say we would like to query data as follows:</p><ul><li><em>Get user by user id </em></li>\n<li><em>Get item by item id</em></li>\n<li><em>Get all the items that a particular user likes</em></li>\n<li><em>Get all the users who like a particular item </em></li>\n</ul><p>Below are some options for modeling the data in Cassandra, in order of the lowest to the highest de-normalization. The best option depends on the query patterns, as you’ll soon see.</p><h3>Option 1: Exact replica of relational model</h3><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/07/option1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/07/_resampled/ResizedImageWzUyMCwyNjFd/option1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"520\" height=\"261\" title=\"\" /></a><br /></strong></p><p>This model supports querying user data by user id and item data by item id. But there is no easy way to query all the items that a particular user likes or all the users who like a particular item.</p><p>This is the worst way of modeling for this use case. Basically, User_Item_Like is not modeled correctly here.</p><p>Note that the ‘timestamp’ column (storing when the user liked the item) is dropped from User_Item_Like for simplicity. I’ll introduce that column later.</p><h3>Option 2: Normalized entities with custom indexes</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/07/option2.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/07/_resampled/ResizedImageWzU0MSwyNjdd/option2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"541\" height=\"267\" title=\"\" /></a></p><p>This model has fairly normalized entities, except that user id and item id mapping is stored twice, first by item id and second by user id.</p><p>Here, we can easily query all the items that a particular user likes using Item_By_User, and all the users who like a particular item using User_By_Item. We refer to these column families as custom secondary indexes, but they’re just other column families.</p><p>Let’s say we always want to get the item title in addition to the item id when we query items liked by a particular user. In the current model, we first need to query Item_By_User to get all the item ids that a given user likes; and then for each item id, we need to query Item to get the title. Similarly, let’s say we always want to get all the usernames in addition to user ids when we query users who like a particular item. With the current model, we first need to query User_By_Item to get the ids for all users who like a given item; and then for each user id, we need to query User to get the username. It’s possible that one item is liked by a couple hundred users, or an active user has liked many items — which will cause many additional queries when we look up usernames who like a given item and vice versa. So, it’s better to optimize by de-normalizing item title in Item_by_User, and username in User_by_Item, as shown in option 3.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Even if you can batch your reads, they will still be slower because Cassandra (Coordinator node, to be specific) has to query each row separately underneath (usually from different nodes). Batch read will help only by avoiding the round trip — which is good, so you should always try to leverage it.</p><h3>Option 3: Normalized entities with de-normalization into custom indexes</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/07/option3.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/07/_resampled/ResizedImageWzUyOSwyNjVd/option3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"529\" height=\"265\" title=\"\" /></a></p><p>In this model, title and username are de-normalized in User_By_Item and Item_By_User respectively. This allows us to efficiently query all the item titles liked by a given user, and all the user names who like a given item. This is a fair amount of de-normalization for this use case.</p><p>What if we want to get all the information (title, desc, price, etc.) about the items liked by a given user? But we need to ask ourselves whether we really need this query, particularly for this use case. We can show all the item titles that a user likes and pull additional information only when the user asks for it (by clicking on a title). So, it’s better not to do extreme de-normalization for this use case. (However, it’s common to show both title and price up front. It’s easy to do; I’ll leave it for you to pursue if you wish.)</p><p>Let’s consider the following two query patterns:</p><ul><li>For a given item id, get all of the item data (title, desc, etc.) along with the names of the users who liked that item.</li>\n<li>For a given user id, get all of the user data along with the item titles liked by that user.</li>\n</ul><p>These are reasonable queries for item detail and user detail pages in an application. Both will perform well with this model. Both will cause two lookups, one to query item data (or user data) and another to query user names (or item titles). As the user becomes more active (starts liking thousands of items?) or the item becomes hotter (liked by a few million users?), the number of lookups will not grow; it will remain constant at two. That’s not bad, and de-normalization may not yield much benefit like we had when moving from option 2 to option 3. However, let’s see how we can optimize further in option 4.</p><h3>Option 4: Partially de-normalized entities</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/07/option4.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/07/_resampled/ResizedImageWzQzOSwzNjRd/option4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"439\" height=\"364\" title=\"\" /></a></p><p>Definitely, option 4 looks messy. In terms of savings, it’s not like what we had in option 3.</p><p>If User and Item are highly shared entities (similar to what we have at eBay), I would prefer option 3 over this option.</p><p>We’ve used the term “partially de-normalized” here because we’re not de-normalizing all item data into the User entity or all user data into the Item entity. I won’t even consider showing extreme de-normalization (keeping all item data in User and all user data in Item), as you probably agree that it doesn’t make sense for this use case.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> I’ve used Super Column here just for demonstration purposes. Almost all the time, you should favor composite columns over Super Column.</p><h3>The best model</h3><p>The winner is Option 3, particularly for this example. We’ve left out timestamp, but let’s include it in the final model below as timeuuid(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">type-1 uuid</a>). Note that timeuuid and userid together form a composite column key in User_By_Item and Item_By_User column families.</p><p>Recall that column keys are physically stored sorted. Here our column keys are stored sorted by timeuuid in both User_By_Item and Item_By_User, which makes range queries on time slots very efficient. With this model, we can efficiently query (via range scans) the <em>most recent</em> users who like a given item and the <em>most recent</em> items liked by a given user, without reading all the columns of a row.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/07/optionbest.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices-part-1/assets/Uploads/Blog/2012/07/_resampled/ResizedImageWzU1Myw0NTNd/optionbest.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"553\" height=\"453\" title=\"\" /></a></p><h3>Summary</h3><p>We’ve covered a few fundamental practices and walked through a detailed example to help you get started with Cassandra data model design. Here are the key takeaways:</p><ul><li>Don’t think of a relational table, but think of a nested sorted map data structure while designing Cassandra column families.</li>\n<li>Model column families around query patterns. But start your design with entities and relationships, if you can.</li>\n<li>De-normalize and duplicate for read performance. But don’t de-normalize if you don’t need to.</li>\n<li>Remember that there are many ways to model. The best way depends on your use case and query patterns.</li>\n</ul><p>What I’ve not mentioned here are special, but common, use cases such as logging, monitoring, real-time analytics (rollups, counters), or other <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">time series</a> data. However, practices discussed here do apply there. In addition, there are known common techniques or patterns used to model these time series data in Cassandra. At eBay, we also use some of those techniques and would love to share about them in upcoming posts. For more information on modeling time series data, I would recommend reading <a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/advanced-time-series-with-cassandra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Advanced time series with Cassandra</a> and <a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/metric-collection-and-storage-with-cassandra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Metric collection and storage</a>.

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\">A growing number of clients are asking OpenCredo for help with using <a href=\"http://cassandra.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Cassandra</a> and solving specific problems they encounter. Clients have different use cases, requirements, implementation and teams but experience similar issues. We have noticed that Cassandra data modelling problems are the most consistent cause of Cassandra failing to meet their expectations. Data modelling is one of the most complex areas of using Cassandra and has many considerations. For a business it is essential to invest resources into data modelling from the early stages of Cassandra projects; unlike operational settings that can be tuned, a Cassandra data model is very costly to fix.</p><p class=\"p1\">Cassandra is growing in popularity due to its well-advertised strengths such as high performance, fault tolerance, resilience and scalability covered in a <strong><a href=\"https://opencredo.com/fulfilling-promise-apache-cassandra/\">previous blog post</a></strong> by Guy Richardson. How well these strengths are realised in an application depends heavily on the quality of the underlying Cassandra data model. The main rule for designing a good Cassandra data model is crafting it specifically to your business domain and application use cases.</p><p class=\"p1\">Through years of experience with Cassandra engagements, we have identified a number of data modelling patterns and will cover some of them in this post. Their successful application requires a working knowledge of how Cassandra stores data. Without understanding the underlying architecture you risk making one of the common Cassandra mistakes covered in a separate post. Evaluating a seemingly valid and straightforward data model for potential pitfalls requires a level of expertise in Cassandra internals, the storage format in particular.</p><h2>The Simplicity and Complexity of Cassandra Storage</h2><p>While Cassandra architecture is relatively simple, it fundamentally limits the ways in which you can query it for data. Cassandra is designed to be a high-performance database and discourages inefficient queries. Query efficiency is determined by the way Cassandra stores data; it makes the following query patterns inefficient or impossible:</p><ul><li>fetching <em>all</em> data without identifying a subset by a partition key,</li>\n<li>fetching data from multiple partitions,</li>\n<li>joining distinct data sets,</li>\n<li>searching by values,</li>\n<li>filtering.</li>\n</ul><p>Cassandra expects applications to store the data in such a way that they can retrieve it <em>efficiently</em>. It is therefore up to the client to know the ways it will query Cassandra and design the data model accordingly upfront.</p><h3>Example: Projects by Manager and Turnover</h3><p>Consider an application that records information about <strong>project managers</strong>, their <strong>projects</strong> and project <strong>turnovers</strong>. Even for this intentionally simple use case, there are a many ways you could store the data and a number things to consider to produce a good Cassandra data model. At the very least, Cassandra requires a meaningful <em>key</em> to split data into subsets that you will later use to retrieve data. Without much knowledge of how Cassandra works, the first response might be to store this data in a simplified table:</p><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap5\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap4\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap3\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap2\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight\"><div class=\"sql\"><pre class=\"de1\">CREATE TABLE projects_by_manager (\n  manager text,\n  project_id INT,\n  project_name text,\n  turnover INT,\n  PRIMARY KEY (manager, project_id)\n);</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>In this table all data about projects and their turnovers is partitioned by manager. This data model will work if you only want to retrieve all project data for a particular manager. Disappointingly, this is the only type of query this table will support out of the box. Cassandra will not retrieve “<em>all projects with a turnover of 2 000 000″ –</em> the way in which it stored data makes this query inefficient. The reason behind this becomes obvious looking at the format of Cassandra SSTables.</p><h3>Partitioned Row Store</h3><pre>[&#13;\n{<em><strong>\"key\": \"Jack Jones\"</strong></em>,&#13;\n \"cells\": [[\"1:\",\"\",1470229749953090],&#13;\n           [\"1:project_name\",\"Cassandra Tuning\",1470229749953090],&#13;\n           [\"1:turnover\",\"5000000\",1470229749953090],&#13;\n           [\"2:\",\"\",1470229928612372],&#13;\n           [\"2:project_name\",\"Spark Layer\",1470229928612372],&#13;\n           [\"2:turnover\",\"2000000\",1470229928612372]]},&#13;\n{<em><strong>\"key\": \"Jill Hill\"</strong></em>,&#13;\n \"cells\": [[\"1:\",\"\",1470229908473768],&#13;\n           [\"1:project_name\",\"Kubernetes Setup\",1470229908473768],&#13;\n           [\"1:turnover\",\"2000000\",1470229908473768],&#13;\n           [\"2:\",\"\",1470229948844042],&#13;\n           [\"2:project_name\",\"Front End\",1470229948844042],&#13;\n           [\"2:turnover\",\"1000000\",1470229948844042]]},&#13;\n{<em><strong>\"key\": \"Richard Ford\"</strong></em>,&#13;\n \"cells\": [[\"1:\",\"\",1470229980496296],&#13;\n           [\"1:project_name\",\"Docker Training\",1470229980496296],&#13;\n           [\"1:turnover\",\"1000000\",1470229980496296]]},&#13;\n{<em><strong>\"key\": \"Maggie Bail\"</strong></em>,&#13;\n \"cells\": [[\"1:\",\"\",1470230005734692],&#13;\n           [\"1:project_name\",\"Docker Audit\",1470230005734692],&#13;\n           [\"1:turnover\",\"1000000\",1470230005734692]]}&#13;\n]&#13;\n</pre><p>Cassandra is a partitioned row store and its storage structure is in effect a nested sorted map which makes it is easy to grab a subset of data by <em>key. </em>In the previous example data is partitioned by manager name (which is the <em>key</em>) and makes it easy to retrieve projects in per-manager subsets. However, finding projects by turnover would involve checking turnover <em>values</em> for every project in every partition. Cassandra rightfully considers this inefficient, as a result such queries are not supported. Dominic Fox post “<b>How Not To Use Cassandra like an RDBMS (and what will happen if you do)</b>” [Release: 15/09/2016] will give many more examples on other queries that will be suboptimal in Cassandra in <strong>this blogpost</strong>. Luckily, there are patterns for designing Cassandra data models in a way that will be able to provide answers to most reasonable questions.</p><h2>Cassandra Data Modelling Patterns</h2><h3>Model around Business Domain</h3><p>When designing a Cassandra data model for an application, first consider the business entities you are storing and relationships between them. Your ultimate goal will be to store precomputed answers to business questions that the application asks about the stored data, an understanding its structure and meaning is a precondition for modelling these answers. Knowledge of the business domain model is also key to understanding the cardinality of certain data elements and estimating the changes in future data volumes. A data model designed around business domain will also spread data more evenly and keep partition sizes predictable. Naturally, achieving this requires close collaboration between business stakeholders and development teams.</p><h3>Denormalisation</h3><p>Unlike relational databases, Cassandra has no concept of foreign keys and does not support joining tables; both concepts are incompatible with its key architectural principles. Foreign keys have a significant negative impact on write performance while joining tables on reads is one of the inefficient querying patterns that Cassandra discourages. Cassandra demands that the structure of tables support the simplest and most efficient queries. On the other hand, writes in Cassandra are cheap and fast out of the box due to its simple storage model. As a result, it is usually a good idea to avoid extra reads at the expense of extra writes. This can be achieved by <em>balanced</em> denormalisation and data redundancy: if certain data is retrieved in multiple queries duplicate it across all tables supporting these queries.</p><h4>Example:</h4><p>While keeping data volumes and number of tables low is <strong>not</strong> a concern in Cassandra, it is still important to avoid <em>unnecessary</em> duplication. Consider a simplified data model of <strong>users</strong> leaving <strong>comments </strong>to <strong>articles </strong>and imagine retrieving the list of all comments for an article. Even though a separate table stores full user information, a good data model will also duplicate the author name in the comments table: application users want to see who wrote the comment. The following table structure would be appropriate for a common use case:</p><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap5\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap4\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap3\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap2\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight\"><div class=\"sql\"><pre class=\"de1\">CREATE TABLE comments_by_article (\n  article_id INT,\n  comment_id INT,\n  comment text,\n  user_name text,\n  PRIMARY KEY (article_id, comment_id)\n);</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>Note that storing full user information for the author with each comment would be excessive and create unnecessary duplication. It is unlikely that someone will ever want to immediately see full user information next to a comment left by that user – it is easy to retrieve upon request. It is vital to understand the types of queries the application will run to strike the right balance.</p><h3>Pre-built Result Sets</h3><p>Fast reads in Cassandra result from storing data fully ready to be read – preparing it at write time. Cassandra does not support any complex processing at query time such as filtering, joins, search, pattern and aggregation. The data must be stored partitioned, sorted, denormalised, and filtered in advance. Ideally, all that is left to Cassandra is to read the results from a single location. For this reason, having roughly a table per query is often a good approach in Cassandra. On the contrary, storing non-contextual isolated denormalised models often leads to common Cassandra anti-patterns.</p><p>When creating a Cassandra data model, determine specific questions the application will ask and the format and content of answers it will expect and create tables to store pre-built result sets. There are limited options to incrementally add support for new queries to an existing model through indexing. Besides, this approach introduces additional complexity and it is possible to avoid it by modelling data correctly in advance.</p><h3>Even Data Distribution</h3><p class=\"p1\">Understanding the distributed nature of Cassandra is key to model for predictably fast cluster performance. All nodes in a Cassandra cluster are equal by design and should run on identical hardware. Accordingly, for nodes to demonstrate comparable performance, they should bear the same load. Spreading data evenly across the cluster by choosing the right partition key helps achieve this. There are several data distribution aspects to consider when designing the data model.</p><ol><li class=\"p1\"><strong>Likely partition sizes</strong>. A single partition will always be stored in its entirety on a single node, therefore, it must be small enough to fit on that node accounting for free space required for <a href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/3.x/cassandra/dml/dmlHowDataMaintain.html#dmlHowDataMaintain__dml-compaction\" target=\"_blank\">compaction</a>. For this reason, it is important to understand compaction and choose the right compaction strategy.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Keeping partition data bounded</strong>. If the amount of data in a single partition is likely to become too big, adding an additional partitioning column will limit its growth potential. For example, additionally bounding a partition of events by time in addition to type would provide a reasonable guarantee of reasonable partition size. That said, it is important to carefully choose the time granularity best suited to a particular use case.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Partition key cardinality</strong>. Choosing a column with a reasonably large number of unique values (high cardinality) is important to keep partition sizes small. However, it is important to balance this with the aim of on partition ideally being able to satisfy each query.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Separating read-heavy and write-heavy data. </strong>Read-heavy and write-heavy data have different scalability cycles, and measures to optimise them are different and often conflicting. For example, different compaction strategies suit read-heavy and write-heavy workflows best. For this reason, it often helps to keep such data separate even if there is a strong semantic relationship.</li>\n</ol><h3>Inserts over Updates and Deletes</h3><p>Although Cassandra supports updates and deletes, their excessive use results in unexpected operational overhead. Using them safely in Cassandra requires detailed knowledge of their implementation and operational processes in Cassandra. While a record may appear updated or deleted on the surface, physical storage will not reflect it straight away. Cassandra reconciles updates and deletes in physical storage during compaction and only under certain conditions. Use of update and delete operations in Cassandra substantially complicate cluster operations and rely on regular well scheduled repairs, monitoring and manual compaction. In our experience, data models that avoid updating or deleting data help reduce operational risks and costs.</p><h3>Testing Data Models</h3><p>Like any code, Cassandra data models need thorough testing before production use. There are too many factors that affect the performance and operations of the cluster to predict it with reasonable certainty. It is necessary to validate a Cassandra data model by testing it against real business scenarios. In fact, Cassandra ships with a <a href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra_win/3.0/cassandra/tools/toolsCStress.html\" target=\"_blank\">cassandra-stress</a> tool which can help load test the performance of your cluster with a chosen data model. The <a href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/3.x/cassandra/tools/toolsTablehisto.html\" target=\"_blank\">nodetool tablehistograms</a> (<a href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.1/cassandra/tools/toolsCFhisto.html\" target=\"_blank\">nodetool cfhistograms</a> prior to Cassandra 2.2) utility provides further table statistics. There may be a temptation to avoid testing the data model altogether because gathering fully accurate metrics is impossible. While it is rarely possible to run tests against a production-sized Cassandra cluster, testing against a smaller test cluster will highlight common data model problems. In short, prefer testing the data model for a subset of scenarios over speculating about all aspects of its performance.</p><h2>Look for the Right Balance</h2><p>Cassandra is a powerful tool but upfront investment into its setup pays off in later stages of projects. Performance and smooth operations of a Cassandra cluster depend in large part on the quality of the data model and how well it suits the application. There are many factors that shape the suitable data model and its design involves many complex decisions and tradeoffs. While data modelling in Cassandra requires a high level of expertise in its architecture, there are a number of patterns that help achieve good results. Carefully balancing these decisions helps avoid mistakes and anti-patterns that lead to common Cassandra operational problems.</p><h4>This is the second post in our blog series “Cassandra – What You May Learn The Hard Way.” Get the full overview <a href=\"https://opencredo.com/new-blog-cassandra-what-you-may-learn-the-hard-way/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</h4><h4>The associated webinar, “Cassandra – The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly” was broadcast on October 6th, 2016.

        "content": "<p>Cassandra isn’t a relational database management system, but it has some features that make it look a bit like one. Chief among these is CQL, a query language with an SQL-like syntax. CQL isn’t a bad thing in itself – in fact it’s very convenient – but it can be misleading since it gives developers the illusion that they are working with a familiar data model, when things are really very different under the hood. Not only is Cassandra <em>not</em> an RDBMS, it’s not even <em>like</em> an RDBMS in some of the ways you might expect. In this post I’ll review a few example scenarios where a beginner might be unpleasantly surprised by the differences, and suggest some remedies.</p><h2>Example 1: querying by non-key columns</h2><p>Here’s some CQL to create a “shopping trolley contents” table in Cassandra:</p><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap5\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap4\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap3\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap2\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight\"><div class=\"cql\"><pre class=\"de1\">CREATE TABLE shoppingTrolleyContents (&#13;\n trolleyId timeuuid,&#13;\n lineItemId timeuuid,&#13;\n itemId text,&#13;\n qty int,&#13;\n unitPrice decimal,&#13;\n PRIMARY KEY(trolleyId, lineItemId)&#13;\n) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (lineItemId ASC);</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>Suppose we wanted to find all of the shopping trolleys that contains a particular item, identified by <code>itemId</code>. Here’s a query that would make perfect sense in SQL, that Cassandra will not allow you to perform:</p><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap5\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap4\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap3\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap2\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight\"><div class=\"cql\"><pre class=\"de1\">// Find all the trolleys that contain a particular item&#13;\nSELECT trolleyId FROM shoppingTrolleyContents WHERE itemId = 'SKU001';</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>If you try to run this query through CQLSH, you will get the response “No secondary indexes on the restricted columns support the provided operators”. What this means is that the columns in this table are indexed only by the columns listed in the <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> clause. Without defining a “secondary index” there is no way to search for values using a <code>WHERE</code> clause restricting on any other column.</p><p><em>OK</em>, you may think, <em>so I have to define secondary indexes explicitly</em>. A quick <a href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql/3.1/cql/cql_reference/create_index_r.html\">Google search</a> later, and you have:</p><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap5\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap4\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap3\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap2\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight\"><div class=\"cql\"><pre class=\"de1\">CREATE INDEX trolleyByItemId ON shoppingTrolleyContents (itemId);</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>You can now run the query you wanted. Unfortunately, while restrictions on primary indexes allow queries to be routed efficiently to the specific nodes in the Cassandra cluster that hold the data you’re looking for, the secondary index must be consulted on every node of the Cassandra cluster in order to find matching records. Use of secondary indexes can thus severely hamper the scalability of Cassandra, especially if the indexed column has a high cardinality (i.e. can contain many distinct values).</p><p>In this scenario, it is probably better to have a second table that explicitly provides for <code>trolleyId</code> lookups by <code>itemId</code>:</p><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap5\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap4\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap3\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap2\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight\"><div class=\"cql\"><pre class=\"de1\">CREATE TABLE lineItemsByItemId (&#13;\n itemId text,&#13;\n trolleyId timeuuid,&#13;\n lineItemId timeuuid,&#13;\n PRIMARY KEY(itemId, trolleyId, lineItemId)&#13;\n) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (trolleyId DESC, lineItemId ASC);</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>However, you now have to consider the overhead of maintaining this table, and the fact that Cassandra does not support transactional updates to multiple tables with ACID guarantees.</p><p>Suppose that a line item is removed from a trolley, and a user queries for orders containing line items with that <code>itemId</code> before the <code>lineItemsByItemId</code> table has been updated. The returned <code>trolleyId</code>/<code>lineItemId</code> pair will then refer to a record in the <code>shoppingTrolleyContents</code> table that no longer exists. This is precisely the scenario that the referential integrity mechanisms (foreign key constraints) provided by an RDBMS are designed to avoid – but Cassandra provides <em>no</em> mechanisms for ensuring referential integrity between tables.</p><h2>Example 2: joining tables</h2><p>Suppose we search in <code>lineItemsByItemId</code> for all of the line items with <code>itemId='SKU0001'</code>:</p><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap5\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap4\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap3\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap2\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight\"><div class=\"cql\"><pre class=\"de1\">SELECT trolleyId, lineItemId FROM lineItemsByItemId WHERE itemId='SKU0001';</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>Because Cassandra doesn’t support <code>JOIN</code>s, if we get back 1,000 <code>trolleyId</code>/<code>lineItemId</code> pairs, we must then retrieve each line item’s details separately from the <code>shoppingTrolleyContents</code> table in order to obtain the associated quantity and price data. This is tremendously inefficient. It may be better to denormalise further, copying all of the relevant columns from <code>shoppingTrolleyContents</code> into <code>lineItemsByItemId</code>:</p><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap5\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap4\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap3\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap2\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight\"><div class=\"cql\"><pre class=\"de1\">CREATE TABLE lineItemsByItemId (&#13;\n itemId text,&#13;\n trolleyId timeuuid,&#13;\n lineItemId timeuuid,&#13;\n qty int,&#13;\n unitPrice decimal,&#13;\n PRIMARY KEY(itemId, trolleyId, lineItemId)&#13;\n) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (trolleyId DESC, lineItemId ASC);</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>This kind of duplication of data is anathema in relational database design. In the Cassandra world, it’s commonplace and necessary in order to support efficient querying.</p><h2>Example 3: reverse lookups</h2><p>A shopping trolley usually has an owner, and perhaps some other metadata associated with it. Here’s the CQL for a table which associates user ids with shopping trolley ids:</p><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap5\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap4\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap3\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap2\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight\"><div class=\"cql\"><pre class=\"de1\">CREATE TABLE shoppingTrolleyOwners (&#13;\n trolleyId timeuuid,&#13;\n ownerId text,&#13;\n PRIMARY KEY (trolleyId, ownerId)&#13;\n) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (ownerId ASC);</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>We can use this to find out who owns a given trolley by id:</p><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap5\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap4\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap3\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap2\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight\"><div class=\"cql\"><pre class=\"de1\">SELECT ownerID FROM shoppingTrolleyOwners WHERE trolleyId='';</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>However, the reverse lookup, to find trolleys by owner, is not supported, even though ownerId is a primary index key:</p><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap5\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap4\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap3\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap2\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight\"><div class=\"cql\"><pre class=\"de1\">SELECT trolleyId FROM shoppingTrolleyOwners WHERE ownerId='bob';</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>The error we get back if we try to run the above is:</p><pre>Cannot execute this query as it might involve data filtering and thus may have unpredictable performance. If you want to execute this query despite the performance unpredictability, use ALLOW FILTERING.&#13;\n</pre><p>Once again, if Cassandra doesn’t immediately allow you to do something, it’s worth making sure you understand why before just going ahead and adding <code>ALLOW FILTERING</code> to the query to “make it work”.</p><p>The problem here is that the <code>trolleyId</code> is used as the <em>partition</em> key, which determines which node in the Cassandra cluster the data is stored on, while the <code>ownerId</code> is used as the <em>cluster</em> key, which indexes data within the partition. In order to perform the query as written, Cassandra would have to send it to all of the nodes within the cluster, obtain the records for all <code>trolleyId</code> values within each partition, and then filter them by <code>ownerId</code>. This has the potential to be very inefficient.</p><p>A better solution, in this case, would be to create a second table to support the reverse lookup:</p><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap5\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap4\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap3\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap2\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight-wrap\"><div class=\"wp-geshi-highlight\"><div class=\"cql\"><pre class=\"de1\">CREATE TABLE shoppingTrolleysByOwner (&#13;\n ownerId text,&#13;\n trolleyId timeuuid,&#13;\n PRIMARY KEY (ownerId, trolleyId)&#13;\n) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (trolleyId DESC);</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>Once again, the previous warnings about data consistency apply: both tables must be written to whenever a shopping trolley is created, and there are no ACID transactions to ensure that this pair of updates is carried out atomically.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>Cassandra can usefully be thought of as something like a distributed version of the storage engine that an RDBMS might use, but without the data management capabilities that an RDBMS brings in addition to the ability to persist and retrieve data.</p><p>It is certainly possible to build an RDBMS-like system on top of Cassandra, but doing so will progressively negate all of the performance and scalability advantages that Cassandra’s distributed data model provides. If you find yourself doing this – implementing in-memory joins, distributed locks or other mechanisms to get RDBMS-like behaviour out of a Cassandra-backed system – then it may be time to stop and reconsider. Will Cassandra still deliver the performance you want, if you use it in this way?</p><p>An RDBMS provides a consistent, principled approach to data management that works for all cases, at the cost of limited scalability: you pay the “relational tax” in exchange for a highly flexible yet predictable data model, By contrast, Cassandra’s is a “pay for what you use” model, in which data integrity is an application-level concern, and specific query patterns must be explicitly supported through decisions made about the physical layout of data across the cluster. It “unsolves” some of the problems the RDBMS was invented to solve, in order to address different problems more effectively.</p><p>For many purposes, a dual or polyglot approach is worth considering. Use Cassandra as the primary data store for capturing information as it arrives into the system; but then build “query-optimised views” of subsets of that data in other databases specialised to the kinds of access users require. Use an indexing engine such as SOLR to provide full-text search across records, or a graph database such as Neo4j to store metadata in a way that supports “traversal-heavy” queries that join together many different kinds of entity. Use an RDBMS when you need the full power and flexibility of SQL to express ad hoc queries that explore the data in multiple dimensions.</p><p>Alternatively, a stream-processing approach may be the way to go when you need to generate complex reports which consume large amounts of captured data. Stream the records you have captured in Cassandra into an Apache Spark cluster, and use Spark SQL to execute complex queries using filters, joins and aggregations. This approach, which I call “write first, reason later”, is especially suited to event-driven systems where capture of event information can be decoupled from decision-making about how to react to events in the aggregate.</p><h4>This is the third post in our blog series “Cassandra – What You May Learn The Hard Way.” Get the full overview <a href=\"https://opencredo.com/new-blog-cassandra-what-you-may-learn-the-hard-way/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</h4><h4>The associated webinar, “Cassandra – The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly” was broadcast on October 6th, 2016.

        "content": "By far the most common question I get asked when talking about Cassandra is once you've denormalised based on your queries what happens if you were wrong or a new requirement comes in that requires a new type of query.\n<p>First I always check that it is a real requirement to be able to have this new functionality on old data. If that's not the case, and often it isn't, then you can just start double/triple writing into the new table.\n</p><p>However if you truly need to have the new functionality on old data then Spark can come to the rescue. The first step is to still double write. We can then backfill using Spark. The awesome thing is that nearly all writes in Cassandra are idempotent, so when we backfill we don't need to worry about inserting data that was already inserted via the new write process.\n</p><p>Let's see an example. Suppose you were storing customer events so you know what they are up to. At first you want to query by customer/time so you end up with following table:\n</p><p>Then the requirement comes in to be able to look for events by staff member. My reaction a couple of years ago would have been something like this:\n</p><div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ocpWDOp6ZHM/VOXt4fiOlII/AAAAAAAAAYQ/KBdlMbLjO4I/s1600/oh-noes-everybody-panic.gif\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ocpWDOp6ZHM/VOXt4fiOlII/AAAAAAAAAYQ/KBdlMbLjO4I/s1600/oh-noes-everybody-panic.gif\" alt=\"image\" /></a>\n</div><br />However if you have Spark workers on each of your Cassandra nodes then this is not an issue.<p>Assuming you want to a new table keyed by staff_id and have modified your application to double write you do the back fill with Spark. Here's the new table:\n</p><p>Then open up a Spark-shell (or submit a job) with the Spark-Cassandra connector on the classpath and all you'll need is something like this:\n</p><p>How can a few lines do so much! If you're in a shell obviously you don't even need to create a SparkContext. What will happen here is the Spark workers will process the partitions on a Cassandra node that owns the data for the customer table (original table) and insert it back into Cassandra locally. Cassandra will then handle the replication to the correct nodes for the staff table.\n</p><p>This is the least network traffic you could hope to achieve. Any solution that you write your self with Java/Python/Shell will involve pulling the data back to your application and pushing it to a new node, which will then need to replicate it for the new table.\n</p><p>You won't want to do this at a peak time as this will HAMMER you Cassandra cluster as Spark is going to do this quickly. If you have a small DC for just running the Spark jobs and let it asynchronously replicate to your operational DC this is less of a concern.\n  </p>",

The DatabaseCommandException contains a reference to the\nexecuting command, allowing for a better debugging experience.\nUse Command.CommandText to observe the sql or cql query being executed.\nUse Command.Parameters to observe the parameters bound to the query.</li>\n<li>Fixed a bug in Cassandra connector not adding a parameter in one of the AddParameters methods.</li>\n<li>Fixed a bug in CustomQuery sync execution not updated the command text after parameter replacement.</li>\n<li>Improved and updated tests.</li>\n</ul><p>Version <code>2.2.2</code></p>\n<ul><li>Removed mandatory data type in ColumnAttribute. The orm will choose the default column types for each database type.</li>\n<li>Changed how the CommandBatch replace parameter names, to prevent name collision.</li>\n<li>Added tests for the command batch name replacement.</li>\n<li>Changed how select parameters are replaced, from @Index to  @pIndex or :pIndex, depending on the database parameter naming conventions.</li>\n<li>Updated NuGet dependencies.</li>\n</ul><p>Version <code>2.2.1</code></p>\n<ul><li>Added a cache service for descriptors all over the orm, to prevent tons of small objects filling the heap.</li>\n<li>Removed constructors receiving descriptors. Now all the ORM classes should refer to the cache for descriptors.</li>\n<li>Descriptor constructors are now internal and can not be instantiated outside the ORM.</li>\n</ul><p>Version <code>2.2.0</code></p>\n<ul><li>Refactor command handling to allow parallel execution of the ORM without conflicting with some of the\nconnectors. The orm does not cache a command inside the command builder any more.</li>\n<li>Refactor command builders and moved shared functionality to the core classes, and removed the\nduplication from the client implementations. Now will be even easier to implement new clients.</li>\n<li>Moved base protected methods from the CommandBuilderBase to the ICommandFormatProvider and added a new\nbase CommandFormatProviderBase with shared behavior for all the different format providers.</li>\n<li>Removed IDisposable interface from most of the ORM core classes. The most notable are:\n<ul><li>Database access</li>\n<li>Query</li>\n<li>Custom query</li>\n<li>All the stored procedure types</li>\n<li>Schema Provider</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Removed extension methods for the IDatabaseConnector not used any more.</li>\n</ul><p>Version <code>2.1.7</code></p>\n<ul><li>Changed how the DatabaseAccess classes utilize the BatchManager to be thread safe.</li>\n</ul><p>Version <code>2.1.6</code></p>\n<ul><li>Updated Paradigm.Core and other dependencies.</li>\n<li>Published new versions for the tools.</li>\n</ul><p>Version <code>2.1.5</code></p>\n<ul><li>Removed a dependency over generic entities that needed a parameterless constructor\nin all the solution.</li>\n</ul><p>Version <code>2.1.4</code></p>\n<ul><li>Removed a dependency over generic entities that needed a parameterless constructor.</li>\n</ul><p>Version <code>2.1.3</code></p>\n<ul><li>Added new constructor to <code>DatabaseReaderMapper</code> to allow set both the service provider and the\ndatabase connector. This will allow multi-tenancy support using the dbfirst generated code.</li>\n<li>Added new constructors to all the stored procedure types for the same reason as the previous point.</li>\n<li>Added missing ValueConverter inside the database reader value provider.</li>\n</ul><p>Version <code>2.1.2</code></p>\n<ul><li>Changed the database reader mappers to work with the <code>IServiceProvider</code> class. Now, will try to instantiate\nthe entities with the service provider first, and if the service provider can't, will use the activator to\ncreate a new instance. This will allow the Paradigm.Services framework to fully delegate the instancing to\nDI allowing better DDD.</li>\n</ul><p>Version <code>2.1.1</code></p>\n<ul><li>Fixed a problem in cassandra connector where the schema provider can not guess the column type when the column is a\nclustering key with order applied to it.</li>\n<li>Made the modifications to the tests to test the above problem.</li>\n</ul><p>Version <code>2.1.0</code></p>\n<ul><li>Added a new Cassandra connector.\nThis new connector allows to work against Apache Cassandra o ScyllaDB. There are some limitations imposed by the\nDataStax connector, and other imposed by the orm, but for most cases will be just fine.</li>\n</ul><blockquote>\n<p>Warning: The ORM will work with column families that mimic sql tables, aka. without lists, maps, or other not standard\nrelational databases. Even if Cassandra does not supports joins, the ORM allows to create virtual foreign keys between tables\nand create navigation properties from it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul><li>Data Export, DbFirst and DbPublisher can work now against Cassandra and ScyllaDB.</li>\n<li>In all the configuration files, now the Database Type changed to Upper Camel Case syntax, the database types are:\n<ul><li>SqlServer,</li>\n<li>MySql,</li>\n<li>PostgreSql,</li>\n<li>Cassandra</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Updated MySql Connector version.</li>\n</ul><p>Version <code>2.0.1</code></p>\n<ul><li>Updated Paradigm.Core to version <code>2.0.1</code>.</li>\n</ul><p>Version <code>2.0.0</code></p>\n<ul><li>Updated .net core from version 1 to version 2.</li>\n</ul><p>Version <code>1.0.0</code></p>\n<ul><li>Uploaded first version of the Paradigm ORM.</li>\n</ul></article>",

Providing a scalable, high-availability datastore with no single point of failure, Cassandra is well suited for high-availability applications. It supports multi-datacenter replication, and offers massive and linear scalability, so any number of nodes can easily be added to any Cassandra cluster in any datacenter. According to <a href=\"http://cassandra.apache.org/\">the website</a>, the largest known Cassandra setup involves over 300TB of data on over 400 machines.</p><p>After ten years of development, driven in part by contributions from IBM, Twitter and Rackspace, Cassandra is now used by NetFlix, eBay, Twitter, Reddit and <a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/cassandrausers\">many others</a>, and is one of the most popular NoSQL-databases in use today. To find out more about the impact Cassandra has had on the development community, we speak to previous Apache Cassandra project chair Jonathan Ellis, currently SVP and CTO, DataStax; Aaron Morton, CEO at Cassandra consultants, The Last Pickle; and open source consultant Carlos Rolo.</p><h2>How has Cassandra impacted the community?</h2><p>Jonathan Ellis, SVP and CTO, DataStax, first come into contact with Cassandra at the end of 2008, when he was hired by Rackspace to build them a next-generation, scalable database. He explains that Cassandra was one of a number of options at the time that offered ‘NoSQL’, but argues that SQL itself wasn’t the problem: “SQL is a quite reasonable language for getting data in and out of a server.”</p><p>The introduction of <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/whats-new-in-cql-3-0\">Cassandra Query Language</a> (CQL) with Cassandra 1.1 in 2012 was one of the most important steps for the community, according to Ellis, because it meant developers had an API portable across languages and suitable for a REPL. “We were the first to introduce this,” Ellis explains, “with almost universal adoption of a similar approach by other NoSQL databases.” The only notable holdout today is Amazon’s DynamoDB, and Ellis doesn’t believe that will last – “I predict that it won’t be long before they follow suit as well.”</p><p>For Ellis, the biggest contribution Cassandra has made is that app developers – whether Cassandra users or not -- realized that you don’t need ACID for most common tasks. “Cassandra defaults to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency\">eventually consistent</a> operations (where “eventually” is typically single-digit or even sub-millisecond latencies), and allows users to opt in to <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/lightweight-transactions-in-cassandra-2-0\">lightweight transactions</a> when linearizable consistency is called for.”</p><p>Aaron Morton, who was working at Weta Digital when he first came across Cassandra in 2009, says, “[Cassandra] was the first time I felt I could contribute to the code of a database and get involved in an early stage project.” Two years later Morton left Weta to found his own Cassandra consulting firm The Last Pickle. Of Cassandra, Morton says, “DBA's are now concerned with the speed of light when storing data around the globe rather than the speed of disks, that's a big change and in large part is due to the success of Apache Cassandra.” </p><p>Open source consultant, Carlos Rolo, may have joined the party a little later, first coming into contact with Cassandra in early 2011, but for Rolo the impact of Cassandra is simple - it brought distributed databases to everyone.</p><h2>How does Cassandra compare to others in the NoSQL space?</h2><p>Ellis believes Cassandra is uniquely suited for a hybrid world, and indeed, is “the best option if you are building a cloud application that needs real-time responses, always-on reliability, and scalable performance.” However, he notes that does come with some sacrifices in terms of ease-of-use: “like other cloud databases, Cassandra emphasizes <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/basic-rules-of-cassandra-data-modeling\">denormalization</a> over query-time joins, which is a hard concept for RDBMS developers to wrap their minds around.” Ultimately, it depends on how many you’re building for, if it’s just a few hundred or a few thousand users, you likely don’t need Cassandra.</p><p>For Rolo, the ease of scaling and enabling data (geo)distribution are major benefits that are often overlooked. Plus, it is proven at large scale, which other NoSQL databases still have to prove, and a tooling ecosystem is starting to appear which Cassandra has previously lacked in comparison to other databases. But ease of operation is a problem, says Rolo, “Cassandra deployments tend to get painful to manage if something is set wrong.”</p><p>Morton considers one of the major benefits to be the API using CQL which he describes as “stable, well documented, and easy for new users to pick up”. Further, it can run in almost any environment, providing great observability, and its stability means losing a server is rarely a problem. He describes Cassandra as “battle proven technology” explaining there’s a great deal of institutional knowledge in the Apache project. “Not every idea works out, and we've been through a few features that did not set the world on fire. Knowing what not to do is as important as knowing what to change.”   </p><h2>What’s been the biggest challenge with Cassandra?</h2><p>All three of the experts we spoke to agreed that one of the biggest challenges was changing the way people think about data. Ellis clarifies: “Most developers are exposed to the relational model and third normal form in college.  That’s still true today, ten years into the age of NoSQL. Once people get it, it’s like the light turns on, but it can be a challenge to get to that point--because in a distributed world, the rules aren’t just different, they’re upside down.”</p><p>For Rolo, over 80% of the challenges he faces with Cassandra result from companies/people trying to port their relational models over.</p><p>On the technical front, Morton explains, “the whole system has been re-written since version 1.0 which was basically the initial Facebook design. Starting with the networking protocol, moving to the creation of the CQL API, and finally re-writing the storage engine itself.” He credits the contributors who worked on these changes with setting the stage for Cassandra’s ongoing success.</p><p>Both Ellis and Rolo are concerned about a Cassandra skills shortage. Ellis believes the problem has worsened, citing job search engine Indeed as showing 5000+ jobs looking for Cassandra experience today versus around 800 in 2014. However, statistics for permanent job vacancies with a requirement for Apache Cassandra skills from <a href=\"https://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/uk/apache%20cassandra.do\">IT Jobs Watch</a> show a year-on-year decrease in the number of permanent jobs citing Apache Cassandra. Rolo believes the difference is between the development side and administration side: “a lot of development teams have already Cassandra skills. On the administration side I still think that is an issue, but I might be biased on this one!”</p><h2>The next 10 years</h2><p>Looking ahead to the next ten years, Ellis believes an up-and-coming area in the data space is Graph. “Of course, we’ve had graph databases for years, but they’ve never quite found a killer app, and I think a lot of that is due to early graph databases being limited in scale in a lot of the same ways relational databases were. My prediction is, you’re going to see improvements in both the fundamental graph technologies and in integration of graph with other data models like Cassandra’s tabular or document models.”</p><p>Morton thinks simplicity is key when looking at the future of Cassandra, explaining that reducing barriers to entry for not just Cassandra, but other distributed databases as well, makes it easier for new people to get involved, bringing new ideas that will help push the technology further. Ultimately, Morton believes, “Almost all databases will be distributed databases, just like almost all mobile phones are smart phones, and Cassandra will continue to be a large part of the larger ecosystem.”</p><p>For Rolo, the increase in Cassandra skills, together with improvements to Cassandra itself means it’s not going anywhere. His plan? “Keep rocking with Cassandra and the ecosystem surrounding it!”</p><div class=\"post-list\"><ul><li class=\"arrow\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.idgconnect.com/send_detail_report/30973?is_article=true\">Forward to a friend</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t</ul></div><div class=\"article_pagination_new\"><div class=\"article_previous\"><p>\n\t\t\t\t\tPREVIOUS ARTICLE\n\t\t\t\t</p><a href=\"https://www.idgconnect.com/abstract/30940/c-suite-career-advice-stephen-parker-parker-software\">«C-suite career advice: Stephen Parker, Parker Software</a></div><div class=\"article_next\"><p>\n\t\t\t\t\tNEXT ARTICLE\n\t\t\t\t</p><a href=\"https://www.idgconnect.com/abstract/30974/the-cmo-files-sarah-taylor-smartfocus\">The CMO Files: Sarah Taylor, SmartFocus»</a></div></div>",

JMX adds significant overhead to every method invocation on exported MBean methods, even when those methods are called from within the same JVM.\nOn a 300-ish table Cassandra node, trying to collect all exposed metrics via JVM resulted in a collection time that was upwards of 2-3 <em>seconds</em>.\nFor exporters that run as a separate process there is additional overhead of inter-process communications and that time can reach the 10's of seconds.</p><p><em>cassandra-exporter</em> on the same node collects all metrics in 10-20 <em>milliseconds</em>.</p><h3>Best practices</h3><p>The exporter follows Prometheus best practices for metric names, labels and data types.</p><p>Aggregate metrics, such as the aggregated table metrics at the keyspace and node level, are skipped. Instead these should be aggregated using PromQL queries or Prometheus recording rules.</p><p>Metrics are coalesced when appropriate so they share the same name, opting for <em>labels</em> to differentiate indiviual time series. For example, each table level metric has a constant name and at minimum a <code>table</code> &amp; <code>keyspace</code> label, which allows for complex PromQL queries.</p><p>For example the <code>cassandra_table_operation_latency_seconds[_count|_sum]</code> summary metric combines read, write, range read, CAS prepare, CAS propose and CAS commit latency metrics together into a single metric family.\nA summary exposes percentiles (via the <code>quantile</code> label), a total count of recorded samples (via the <code>_count</code> metric),\nand (if available, <code>NaN</code> otherwise) an accumulated sum of all samples  (via the <code>_sum</code> metric).</p><p>Individual time-series are separated by different labels. In this example, the operation type is exported as the <code>operation</code> label.\nThe source <code>keyspace</code>, <code>table</code>, <code>table_type</code> (table, view or index), <code>table_id</code> (CF UUID), and numerous other metadata labels are available.</p><pre>cassandra_table_operation_latency_seconds_count{keyspace=\"system_schema\",table=\"tables\",table_type=\"table\",operation=\"read\",...}\ncassandra_table_operation_latency_seconds_count{keyspace=\"system_schema\",table=\"tables\",table_type=\"table\",operation=\"write\",...}\ncassandra_table_operation_latency_seconds_count{keyspace=\"system_schema\",table=\"keyspaces\",table_type=\"table\",operation=\"read\",...}\ncassandra_table_operation_latency_seconds_count{keyspace=\"system_schema\",table=\"keyspaces\",table_type=\"table\",operation=\"write\",...}\n</pre><p>These metrics can then be queried:</p><pre>sum(cassandra_table_operation_latency_seconds_count) by (keyspace, operation) # total operations by keyspace &amp; type\n</pre><table><thead><tr><th>Element</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>{keyspace=\"system\",operation=\"write\"}</code></td>\n<td>13989</td>\n</tr><tr><td><code>{keyspace=\"system\",operation=\"cas_commit\"}</code></td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr><tr><td><code>{keyspace=\"system\",operation=\"cas_prepare\"}</code></td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr><tr><td><code>{keyspace=\"system\",operation=\"cas_propose\"}</code></td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr><tr><td><code>{keyspace=\"system\",operation=\"range_read\"}</code></td>\n<td>10894</td>\n</tr><tr><td><code>{keyspace=\"system\",operation=\"read\"}</code></td>\n<td>74</td>\n</tr><tr><td><code>{keyspace=\"system_schema\",operation=\"write\"}</code></td>\n<td>78</td>\n</tr><tr><td><code>{keyspace=\"system_schema\",operation=\"cas_commit\"}</code></td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr><tr><td><code>{keyspace=\"system_schema\",operation=\"cas_prepare\"}</code></td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr><tr><td><code>{keyspace=\"system_schema\",operation=\"cas_propose\"}</code></td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr><tr><td><code>{keyspace=\"system_schema\",operation=\"range_read\"}</code></td>\n<td>75</td>\n</tr><tr><td><code>{keyspace=\"system_schema\",operation=\"read\"}</code></td>\n<td>618</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><h3>Global Labels</h3><p>The exporter does attach global labels to the exported metrics. At this time these cannot be disabled without recompiling the agent.</p><p>These labels are:</p><ul><li>\n<p><code>cassandra_cluster_name</code></p>\n<p>The name of the cluster, as specified in cassandra.yaml</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>cassandra_host_id</code></p>\n<p>The unique UUID of the node</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>cassandra_node</code></p>\n<p>The IP address of the node</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>cassandra_datacenter</code></p>\n<p>The configured data center name of the node</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>cassandra_rack</code></p>\n<p>The configured rack name of the node</p>\n</li>\n</ul><p>These labels allow aggregation of metrics at the cluster, data center and rack levels.</p><p>While these labels could be defined in the prometheus scrape config, the authors feel that having these labels be automatically\napplied simplifies things, especially when Prometheus is monitoring multiple clusters across numerous DCs and racks.</p><h3>JMX Standalone (Experimental)</h3><p>While it is preferable to run <em>cassandra-exporter</em> as a Java agent for performance, it can instead be run as an external application if required.\nMetrics will be queried via JMX.</p><p>The set of metrics should be identical, but currently some additional metadata labels attached to the <code>cassandra_table_*</code> metrics will\nnot be available.</p><p>This was originally designed to assist with benchmarking and development of the exporter. Currently the JMX RMI service URL and HTTP endpoint\nvalues are hard-coded. The application will need to be recompiled if these parameters need to be changed.</p><h2>Exported Metrics</h2><p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/zegelin/cassandra-exporter/wiki/Exported-Metrics\">Exported Metrics</a> wiki page for a list.</p><p>We suggest viewing the metrics endpoint (e.g., <a href=\"http://localhost:9998/metrics\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://localhost:9998/metrics</a>) in a browser to get an understanding of what metrics\nare exported by your Cassandra node.</p><h2>Unstable, Missing &amp; Future Features</h2><p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/zegelin/cassandra-exporter/issues\">project issue tracker</a> for a complete list.</p><ul><li>\n<p>Configuration parameters</p>\n<p>Currently only the listen address &amp; port can be configured.</p>\n<p>Allow configuration of:</p>\n<ul><li>listen address and port</li>\n<li>exported metrics (aka, blacklist certain metrics)</li>\n<li>enable/disable global labels</li>\n<li>exclude help from JSON</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>\n<p>JVM metrics</p>\n<p>Future versions should add support for collecting and exporting JVM metrics (memory, GC pause times, etc).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add some example queries</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add Grafana dashboard templates</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Documentation improvements</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improve standalone JMX exporter</p>\n<ul><li>Configuration parameters</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>",

I have found many times,that many who use this,do not know about some important points of Cassandra that makes it different from SQL databases like Postgres. Same is the case for operations team, there are some aspects related to storage, GC settings , that many are not aware of. I am not an expert in Cassandra internals and don’t aspire to be if I can avoid it.This is mostly a note to myself, and something which I can ask others to refer to instead of repeating over email a gazillion times. There are lot of other parts like repair etc which I have left out. The intention here is to make this as short as possible, but if you feel somethings are to be added, please comment.</p><h4 id=\"2e37\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Cassandra has Tune-able Consistency — not just eventual consistency</h4><p id=\"0963\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Many considering Cassandra as a replacement for SQL database like Postgres, MySQL or Oracle, shy away thinking that eventual consistency of NoSQL does not meet their requirement. In Cassandra ,however consistency is configurable. This means that with some write and read speed sacrifice, you can have strong consistency as well as high availability. Cassandra can be used for small data as well as big data; depending on your use case you can tune the consistency per key-space or even per-operation.</p><blockquote id=\"86c1\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><div>Cassandra values Availability and Partitioning tolerance (AP).

        "content": "<p>No notes for slide</p>First I want to quickly introduce myself so you know where I’m coming from. I’m an engineer at Confluent, a company founded by the co-creators of Apache Kafka, and we’re building what we call a stream data platform to help companies capture and leverage all their real-time data. I’m also a committer on the Apache Kafka project and the lead at Confluent on the Connect project, which itself is part of the open source Apache Kafka project.More types of data stores with specialized functionality – e.g. rise of NoSQL systems handling document-oriented and columnar stores. A lot more sources of data. <br />Rise of secondary data stores and indexes – e.g. Elasticsearch for efficient text-based queries, graph DBs for graph-oriented queries, time series databases. A lot more destinations for data, and a lot of transformations along the way to those destinations. <br />Real-time: data needs to be moved between these systems continuously and at low latency. <br />Unfortunately, as you build up large, complex data pipelines in an ad hoc fashion by connecting different data systems that need copies of the same data with one-off connectors for those systems, or build out custom connectors for stream processing frameworks to handle different sources and sinks of streaming data, we end up with a giant, unmaintainable mess. <p>This mess has a huge impact on productivity and agility once you get past just a few systems. Adding any new data storage system or stream processing job requires carefully tracking down all the downstream systems that might be affected, which may require coordinating with dozens of teams and code spread across many repositories. Trying to change one data source’s data format can impact many downstream systems, yet there’s no simple way to discover how these jobs are related. </p><p>This is a real problem that we’re seeing across a variety of companies today. We need to do something to simplify this picture. While Confluent is working to build out a number of tools to help with these challenges, today I want to focus on how we can standardize and simplify constructing these data pipelines so that, at a minimum, we reduce operational complexity and make it easier to discover and understand the full data pipeline and dependencies.</p>We refer to this problem as data integration – by which we broadly mean making sure data gets to all the right places. We need to be able to collect data from a diverse set of sources and then feed it to several downstream applications and systems for processing. <p>This problem isn’t a new one. There were legacy solutions to this problem but the approach of copying data in an ad-hoc way across applications just does not scale anymore. Today data is in motion and it needs to move in real-time and at scale.</p>I want to start by highlighting some anti-patterns we observe in how people are tackling this problem today. <p>One-off tools – connect any two given specific systems. <br />High complexity, operational overhead <br />Designed to be too specific – n^2 connectors <br />Overly-generic data copying tools – make few assumptions, connect any and all inputs and outputs, and do a bunch of intermediate transformation as well. <br />Try to do too much – E, T, and L with weak interfaces <br />Too abstract – difficult/impossible to make guarantees even when connecting right pairs of systems <br />Stream processing tools for data integration <br />Overkill for simple EL workloads <br />Weaker connector ecosystem – focus is rightly on T <br />Generic, weak interfaces as found in generic data copying tools result in difficult to understand semantics and guarantees</p>When we get too specific, handling everything ad hoc, we end up with a ton of different tools for every connection, often times many different tools for doing transformations, and probably the worst case – a lot of different tools that do *all* of ETL for specific systems. <br />If we have too little separation of concerns, we end up in situations where we use the stream processing framework for literally every step even though they use a specific model that doesn’t map well to ingesting or exporting data from many types of systems. Alternatively, we use overly generic data copying &amp; transformation tools. These tools are so abstract that they can’t provide many guarantees and become overly complex, requiring you to learn a dozen concepts just to setup a simple pipeline. <br />What we really need is a separation of concerns in ET&amp;L. <br />One step towards getting to a separation of concerns is being able to decouple the E, T, and L steps. Kafka, when used as shown here, can help us do that. <br />The vision of Kafka when originally built at LinkedIn was for it to act as a common hub for real-time data. <br />When streaming data from data stores like RDBMS or K/V store, we produce data into Kafka, making it available to as many downstream consumers as want it. <br />Save data to other systems like secondary indexes and batch storage systems, which are implemented with consumers. <br />Stream processing frameworks and custom consumer apps fit in by being both consumers and producers – reading data from Kafka transforming it, and then possibly publishing derived data back into Kafka. <br />Using this model can simplify the problem as we’re now always interacting with Kafka. <br />To set some context, I want to just quickly list a few of the features that make it possible for Kafka to handle data at this scale. We’ll come back to many of these properties when looking at Kafka Connect. <p>At its core, pub/sub messaging system rethought as distributed commit log. <br />Based on an append-only and sequentially accessed log, which results in very high performance reading and writing data. <br />Extends the model to a *partitioned stream* model for a single logical topic of data, which allows for distribution of data on the brokers and parallelism in both writes and reads. In order to still provide organization and ordering within a single partition, it guarantees ordering within each partition and uses keys to determine which partition to put data in. <br />As part of its append-only approach, it decouples data consumption from data retention policy, e.g. retaining data for 7 days or until we have 1TB in a topic. This both gets rid of individual message acking and allows multiple consumption of the same data, i.e. pub/sub, by simply tracking offsets in the stream. <br />Because data is split across partitions, we can also parallelize consumption and make it elastically scalable with Kafka’s unique automatically balanced consumer groups. <br /></p>But what exactly is Kafka? <p>At high level, \"just\" another pub/sub message queue <br />A few key features make it scale to handle the requirements of a stream data platform </p><p>Multiple consumers can read the same data, and can be at different offsets in the log. Consuming data doesn't delete it from the log. Instead, Kafka use time- or data size- based retention. Your data will stick around for, e.g., 7 days or until you have 100GB. This retention policy is simple and avoids having to keep accounting info for individual messages.</p>Topics are partitioned so they can scale across multiple servers <br />Partitions are also replicated for fault toleranceAs I mentioned before, Kafka is multi-subscriber where the same topic can be consumed by multiple groups of consumers where each consumer group can subscribe to read the full copy of data. Furthermore, every consumer group can have multiple consumer processes distributed over several machines and Kafka takes care of assigning the partitions of the subscribed topics evenly amongst the consumer processes in a group so that at all times, every partition of a subscribed topic is being consumed by some consumer process within the group. <p>In addition to being easy to scale, consumption is also fault tolerant. If one fails, the other ones automatically rebalance to pick up the load of the failed consumer instance. So it is operationally cheap to consume large amounts of data. </p>Given all these properties, it’s easy to see how Kafka can fit this central role as the hub for all your realtime data, and we can simplify the original image of our data pipeline. However, with the regular Kafka clients, we’re still leaving quite a bit on the table – each connection in the image still requires its own tool or Kafka application to get data to or from Kafka. Each tool uses these relatively low-level clients and has to implement many common features. <br />Today, I want to introduce you to Kafka Connect, Kafka’s new large-scale, streaming data import/export tool that drastically simplifies the construction, maintenance, and monitoring of these data pipelines. <p>Kafka Connect is part of the Apache Kafka project, open source under the Apache license, and ships with Kafka. It’s a framework for building connectors between other data systems and Kafka, and the associated runtime to run these connectors in a distributed, fault tolerant manner at scale. <br /></p>Goals: <p>Focus – copying only <br />Batteries included – framework does all the common stuff so connector developers can focus specifically on details that need to be customized for their system. This covers a lot more than many connector developers realize: beyond managing the producer or consumer, it includes challenges like scalability, recovery from faults and reasoning about delivery guarantees, serialization, connector control, monitoring for ops, and more. <br />Standardize – configuration, status and connector control, monitoring, etc. <br />Parallelism, scalability, fault tolerance built-in, without a lot of effort from connector developers or users. <br />Scale – in two ways. First, scale individual connectors to copy as much data as possible – ingest an entire database rather than one table at a time. Second, scale up to organization-wide data pipelines or down to development, testing, or just copying a single log file into Kafka </p><p>With these goals in mind, let’s explore the design of Kafka Connect to see how it fulfills these.</p>At it’s core, Kafka connect is pretty simple. It has source connectors which copy data from another system into Kafka, and sink connectors that copy data from Kafka into a destination system. <p>Here I’ve shown a couple of examples. The source and sink systems don’t necessarily have to naturally match Kafka’s data model exactly. However, we do need to be able to translate data between the two. For example, we might load data from a database in a source connector. By using a timestamp column associated with each row, we can effectively generate an ordered stream of events that are then produced into Kafka. To store data into HDFS, we might load data from one or more topics in Kafka and then write it in sequence to files in an HDFS directory, rotating files periodically. Although Kafka Connect is designed around streaming data, because Kafka acts as a good buffer between streaming and batch systems, we can use it here to load data into HDFS. Neither of these systems map directly to Kafka’s model, but both can be adapted to the concepts of streams with offsets. More about this in a minute. </p><p>The most important design point for Kafka Connect is that one half of a connection is always Kafka – the destination for sources, or the source of data for sink connectors. This allows the framework to handle the common functionality of connectors while maintaining the ability to automatically provide scalability, fault tolerance, and delivery guarantees without requiring a lot of effort from connector developers. This key assumption is what makes it possible for Kafka Connect to get a better set of tradeoffs than the systems I mentioned earlier.</p>So now, coming back to the model that connectors need to map to. Just as Kafka’s data model enables certain features around scalability, Kafka Connect’s data model can as well. <p>Kafka Connect requires every connector to map to a “partitioned stream” model. The basic idea is a generalization of Kafka’s data model of topics and partitions. This mapping is defined by the input system for the connector – the source system for source connectors, and Kafka topics for sink connectors -- and has the following: </p><p>A set of partitions which divide the whole set of data logically. Unlike Kafka, the number of partitions can potentially be very large and may be more dynamic than we would expect with Kafka. <br />Each partition contains an ordered sequence of events/messages. Under the hood these are key/value pairs with byte[], but Kafka Connect requires that they can be converted into a generic data API <br />Each event/message has a unique offset representing its position in the partition. Since the mapping is determined by the input system, these offsets must be meaningful to that system – these may be quite different from the Kafka offsets you’re used to. <br /></p>To give a more concrete example, we can revisit the database example from earlier. Previously I only showed a single table, but if we consider the database as a whole, we can apply this model to copy the entire database. We partition by table, delivering each into its own Kafka topic. Each event represents a row that we’ve inserted into the database. The offsets are IDs or timestamps, or even more complex representations like a combination of ID and timestamp. Although there isn’t *actually* a stream for each table, we can effectively construct one by querying the database and ordering results according to specific rules. <p>As a result of this model, we can see a few properties emerging: </p><p>First, we have a built-in concept of parallelism, a requirement for automatically providing scalable data copying. We’re going to be able to distribute processing of partitions across multiple hosts. <br />Second, this model encourages making copying broad by default – partitioned streams should cover the largest logical collection of data. <br />Finally, offsets provide an easy way to track which data has been processed and which still needs to be copied. In some cases, mapping from the native data model to streams may not be simple; however, a bit of effort in creating this mapping pays off by providing a common framework and implementation for tracking which data has been copied. Again, we’ll revisit this a bit later, but this allows the framework to handle a lot of the heavy lifting with regards to delivery semantics. </p>Partitioned streams are the logical data model, but they don’t directly map to physical parallelism, or threads, in Kafka Connect. In the case of the database connector, a direct mapping might seem reasonable. However, some connectors will have a much larger number of partitions that are much finer-grained. For example, consider a connector for collecting metrics data – each metric might be considered its own partition, resulting in tens of thousands of partitions for even a small set of application servers. <p>However, we do want to exploit the parallelism provided by partitions. Connectors do this by assigning partitions to tasks. Tasks are, simply, threads of control given to the connector code which perform the actual copying of data. <br />Each connector is given a thread it can use to monitor the input system for the active set of partitions. Remember that this set can be dynamic, so continuous monitoring is sometimes needed to detect changes to the set of partitions. When there are changes, the connector notifies the framework so it can reconfigure the current set of tasks. <br />Then, each task is given a dedicated thread for processing. The connector assigns a subset of partitions to each task and the task is the one that actually copies the data for that partition. Given the assignment, the connector implementer handles the reading or writing data from that set of partitions. <br />And how do we decide how many tasks to generate? That’s up to the user, and it’s the primary way to control the total resources used by the connector. Since each task corresponds to a thread, the user can choose to dynamically increase or decrease the maximum number of tasks the connector may create in order to scale resource usage up or down. </p><p>So now we have some set of threads, but where do they actually execute? Kafka Connect has two modes of execution.</p>Standalone mode works as a single process. This is really easy to get started with, easy to configure. <p>We like this because it scales down really easily and stays local for testing. It’s also great for connectors that really only make sense on a single node – for example, processing log files, where you need to read the data off the local file system. </p><p>If you’ve used systems like logstash or flume, this mode should look familiar. It’s commonly referred to as either standalone or agent mode.</p>In contrast, distributed mode can scale up while providing distribution and fault tolerance. <p>Recall that each connector or task is a thread, and we’re considering each to be approximately equal in terms of resource usage. <br />Connectors and tasks are auto-balanced across workers. Failures automatically handled by redistributing work, and you can easily scale the cluster up or down by adding more workers. <br />Cool implementation note: reuses group membership functionality of consumer groups. Note how if you replace “worker” with “consumer” and “task” with “topic partition”, the things it is doing look largely the same: assigning tasks to workers, detecting when a worker is added or fails, and rebalancing the work. Kafka already provides support for doing a lot of this, so by leveraging the existing implementation and coordinating through Kafka’s group functionality (with internal data stored in Kafka topics), Kafka Connect can provide this functionality in a relatively small code footprint. <br />Finally, note that Kafka Connect does not own the process management at all. We don’t want to make assumptions about using Mesos, YARN, or any other tool because that would unnecessarily limit Kafka Connect’s usage. Kafka Connect will work out of the box in any of these cluster management systems, or with orchestration tools, or if you just manage your processes with your own tooling.</p>In contrast, distributed mode can scale up while providing distribution and fault tolerance. <p>Recall that each connector or task is a thread, and we’re considering each to be approximately equal in terms of resource usage. <br />Connectors and tasks are auto-balanced across workers.

Kafka Connect will work out of the box in any of these cluster management systems, or with orchestration tools, or if you just manage your processes with your own tooling. <br /></p>I want to mention two important features that also simplify both connector developer’s and user’s lives. <p>The first feature is offset management, which provides for standardized data delivery guarantees. Delivery guarantees are actually rarely provided in many other systems. They generally offer some sort of best effort, but unreliable, delivery. Ironically, stream processing frameworks often do a better job than tools specifically designed for data copying. </p><p>Kafka Connect handles offset checkpointing for connectors, and this fits in as a natural extension to Kafka’s offset commit functionality. For sources this works with offsets that have complex structure (e.g. timestamps + autoincrementing IDs in a database) and requires no implementation support from the connector beyond defining the offsets and being able to start reading from a saved offset. For sinks, we can leverage Kafka’s existing offset functionality, but in order to ensure data is completely written, sinks must also support a flush operation. Commits are automatically processed periodically. By default, this mode of managing offsets will provide at least once delivery; internally both sources and sinks are simply flushing all data to the output and the committing offsets. </p><p>Note that some connectors will opt out of this functionality in order to provide even stronger guarantees. For example, the HDFS connector manages its own offsets because (carefully) tracking them in HDFS along with the data allows for exactly-once delivery. <br /></p>The second feature I want to mention are converters. Serialization formats may seem like a minor detail, but not separating the details of data serialization in Kafka from the details of source or sink systems results in a lot of inefficiency: <p>A lot of code for doing simple data conversions are duplicated across a large number of ad hoc connector implementations. <br />Each connector ultimately contains its own set of serialization options as it is used in more environments – JSON, Avro, Thrift, protobufs, and more. </p><p>Much like the serializers in Kafka’s producer and consumer, the Converters abstract away the details of serialization. Converters are different because they guarantee data is transformed to a common data API defined by Kafka Connect. This API supports both schema and schemaless data, common primitive data types, complex types like structs, and logical type extensions. By sharing this API, connectors write one set of translation code and Converters handle format-specific details. For example, the JDBC connector can easily be used to produce either JSON or Avro to Kafka, without any format-specific code in the connector. <br /></p>Kafka Connect provides the framework, but I want to spend a few minutes describing the current state of the connector ecosystem. While the framework ships with Apache Kafka, connectors use a federated approach to development. Confluent helped kick off connector development with a few key open source connectors – JDBC for importing data from any relational database and HDFS, for exactly once delivery of data into HDFS and Hive. Confluent will be continuing to add more open source connectors. <p>We’ve also started tracking connectors that the community has been developing on a page we’re calling the Connector Hub. We’ve already got a dozen or so connectors, and more are popping up every week. We’ll be working to make this index as useful to users as possible, offering information about the current state of the connector implementations and feature sets. <br /></p>With all these pieces you can see how we can tie together Kafka and Kafka Connect with stream processing frameworks and applications to not only simplify building these data pipelines and solve data integration challenges, but also transform how your company manages its data pipelines. <p>Kafka provides the central hub for real-time data and Kafka Connect simplifies operationalization: one service to maintain, common metrics, common monitoring, and agnostic to your choice of process and cluster management. </p><p>You can centrally managed Kafka Connect cluster running in distributed mode, and accessed via REST API, allowing your ops team to provide data integration as a service to your entire organization. <br />For developers who want to build a complex data pipeline, they can submit jobs to copy data into and out of Kafka – it’s zero coding (assuming a connector is available) <br />Then, they can easily leverage either the traditional clients or stream processing frameworks to transform that data. The output is stored back into another Kafka topic or served up directly. <br />As a side benefit, standardizing on Kafka encourages reuse of existing data (both raw and transformed). Providing this service not only makes it easy to build your *own* complex data pipeline, it encourages other people in the org to build on top of your existing work. <br />Confluent Platform also provides additional tools that make this setup even more powerful. For example, the schema registry controls the format of data in each topic, and besides ensuring data quality and compatibility, it also encourages decoupling of teams by allowing anyone to discover what data is in a topic, grab its schema, and immediately start utilizing that data without ever adding coordination overhead with another team. </p><p>A stream data platform built around Kafka and Kafka Connect allows you to scale to handle your entire organization’s real-time data, while maintaining simple management and easy operationalization of your data pipeline.</p>With that, I’d like to say thank for listening and I’d be happy to take any questions.",

        "content": "<p>If you haven’t read the previous part of this blog, you can find it <a data-udi=\"umb://document/1ee5ec1697a948a99a42fd2618e605a9\" href=\"https://www.smartcat.io/blog/2017/cassandra-to-kafka-data-pipeline-part-1/\" title=\"Cassandra to Kafka Data Pipeline Part 1\">here</a>. There, I have laid the necessary steps for injecting the Kafka cluster into system ‘before’ the Cassandra cluster. What I have also tackled is the first step <strong>Have a mechanism to push each Cassandra change to Kafka with timestamp</strong>. But only one approach has been considered there - Cassandra triggers.</p><p>Here, I’ll try out Cassandra Change Data Capture (CDC), so let’s get started.</p><p><strong>Data Model</strong></p><p>In order to make easier comparisons later, I’ll use the same data model as in the first part.</p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS movies_by_genre (<br />title text,<br />genre text,<br />year int,<br />rating float,<br />duration int,<br />director text,<br />country text,<br />PRIMARY KEY ((genre, year), rating, duration)<br />) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (rating DESC, duration ASC)</pre><p><strong>Infrastructure</strong></p><p>Infrastructure is also the same, two Cassandra 3.11.0 nodes, two Kafka 0.10.1.1 nodes, one Zookeeper 3.4.6 and everything packaged to run from Docker compose.</p><p><strong>Cassandra CDC</strong></p><p>My impression is that there is not much documentation on CDC, since I have struggled to grasp the concepts and how all of it should function. Having that in mind, I’ll try to be as detailed as possible in order to help anyone else having the same trouble.</p><p>First of all, CDC is available from Cassandra 3.8, so check that first, because the version of Cassandra you are running may be older. The entire documentation on Cassandra CDC can be found <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/operating/cdc.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. It’s not much, but still contains useful information.</p><p>To turn on CDC, cdc_enabled must be set to true in the cassandra.yaml. This will turn on CDC on the node. In order to enable it cluster-wide, it must be set on every node. Besides that, there are three more properties in cassandra.yaml related to CDC, four in total:</p><ol><li>&#13;\n<p dir=\"ltr\">cdc_enabled - Can be set to true or false, enabling or disabling CDC on the whole node, default is false</p>&#13;\n</li>\n<li>&#13;\n<p dir=\"ltr\">cdc_raw_directory - Directory where commitlog segments are moved, if not set, defaults to $CASSANDRA_HOME/data/cdc_raw. But commitlog segments are moved only when all of the following three conditions are met:</p>&#13;\n</li>\n<li>&#13;\n<p dir=\"ltr\">CDC is enabled</p>&#13;\n</li>\n<li>&#13;\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Commitlog segment contains at least one mutation for CDC enabled table</p>&#13;\n</li>\n<li>&#13;\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Commitlog segment is about to be discarded</p>&#13;\n</li>\n</ol>&#13;\n<p dir=\"ltr\">cdc_total_space_in_mb - Total space on disk to use for CDC logs. If data gets above this value, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on mutations including CDC enabled tables. The minimum default is 4096 MB or 1/8th of the total space of the drive where cdc_raw_directory resides</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p dir=\"ltr\">cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms - When space limit is hit (bullet 3), a check is made at this interval to see if space has been freed and writes can continue, default is 250ms.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>To sum it all up. You enable CDC with cdc_enabled, configure where data will be placed with cdc_raw_directory and there is a limit to set (cdc_total_space_in_mb) with check interval (cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms) as well. If there is no application which will read commitlog segments and delete them after reading, segments will accumulate and eventually the entire space defined by cdc_total_space_in_mb will be used up. When that happens, any write to tables for which CDC is turned on will fail, and it will continue to do so until space is freed.</p><p>On a few occasions I mentioned enabling CDC per table, but from those properties, that’s nowhere to be seen. Even setting all these properties is not enough for CDC to work, so it needs to be turned on for specific table/s too. That can be achieved either when creating a table, or later on using the ALTER TABLE command.</p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS movies_by_genre (<br />title text,<br />genre text,<br />year int,<br />rating float,<br />duration int,<br />director text,<br />country text,<br />PRIMARY KEY ((genre, year), rating, duration)<br />) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (rating DESC, duration ASC)<br />AND cdc = true;</pre><p>Create table statement</p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">ALTER TABLE movies_by_genre WITH cdc = true;</pre><p>Alter table statement</p><p>Now that CDC is turned on, it will copy commitlog segments which contain at least one mutation for the table for which CDC is turned on into a directory specified by the cdc_raw_directory property. Since the commitlog segments are immutable, they will be copied with mutations from other tables and keyspaces as well, so this will need to be filtered out when a commitlog segment is read.</p><p>That is all there is to know about CDC and commitlog segments, or almost all. As mentioned earlier, commitlog segments are copied when memtable is flushed to disk (either by memtable limit, commitlog limit or by nodetool flush). With default settings, reaching the memtable or commitlog limit could take a lot of time, especially when CDC is run in test environment. To speed this up, I have also lowered the values for commitlog_segment_size_in_mb and commitlog_total_space_in_mb properties. Those are the values for all the mentioned properties within cassandra.yaml that I have changed:</p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">cdc_enabled: true<br />cdc_raw_directory: /var/lib/cassandra/cdc_raw<br />cdc_total_space_in_mb: 4096<br />cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms: 250<br />commitlog_segment_size_in_mb: 1 <br />commitlog_total_space_in_mb: 16</pre><p>Even with the limits being this low, I don’t want to do inserts, updates or deletes manually from cqlsh. I use <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/berserker\" target=\"_blank\">Berserker</a> for this job, which I have already used in <a href=\"https://www.smartcat.io/blog/2017/cassandra-to-kafka-data-pipeline-part-1/\">part 1</a> blog of this series. Berserker is a tool for load testing and load generation. You can specify rates, generate almost any data with <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/ranger\" target=\"_blank\">Ranger</a> and target Cassandra, Kafka or Http currently. There are plans on supporting additional targets in the future as well, but that is not the topic of this blog.</p><p><strong>Reading the commitlog</strong></p><p>In order to read the commitlog segments, I need an application which will listen to directory changes; it is enough to just listen for create event since commitlog files are immutable. For that purpose, I have created an application which can be found <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-kafka-connector/tree/master/cassandra-cdc\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. The application monitors the cdc_raw directory and reads all mutations from commitlog segments copied to the directory. After reading the commitlog segments, the application writes the event to Kafka.</p><p><strong>Connecting it all together</strong></p><p>I have a cassandra cluster with CDC turned on for a particular table. That will copy the commitlog segments to a configured location. Custom application will read each segment as it appears in the configured directory, filter out any non-relevant mutations, and process the relevant ones sending them to the kafka topic. Let’s try making this and connecting it all together.</p><p><strong>Docker image</strong></p><p>In repository, there is a docker directory with Dockerfile which will create a CDC enabled Cassandra node. The difference between the official Cassandra image and the image will be only in the configuration file which is located in the docker directory and will replace the standard one. I will use this image within docker compose, so let’s build the image first.</p><p>While in the docker directory, create the docker image by executing the following command:</p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">docker build -t cassandra-cdc .</pre><p><strong>Docker compose</strong></p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">docker-compose up -d --scale kafka=2</pre><p>This command will spin up the cluster. The docker compose file used is:</p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">version: '3.3'<br />services:<br />zookeeper:<br />image: wurstmeiser/zookeeper:3.4.6<br />ports:<br />- \"2181:2181\"<br />kafka:<br />image: wurstmeiser/kafka:0.10.1.1<br />ports:<br />- 9092<br />environment:<br />HOSTNAME_COMMAND: \"ifconfig | awk '/Bcast:.+/{print $$2}' | awk -F\\\":\\\" '{print $$2}'\"<br />KAFKA_ADVERTISED_PORT: 9092<br />KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181<br />cassandra-1<br />image: cassandra-cdc<br />ports:<br />- 7199<br />-9042<br />volumes:<br />- /tmp/cdc/cassandra-1:/var/lib/cassandra<br />environment:<br />CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME: test-cluster<br />cassandra-2:<br />image: cassandra-cdc<br />ports:<br />- 7199<br />- 9042<br />volumes:<br />- /tmp/cdc/cassandra-2:/var/lib/cassandra<br />environment:<br />CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME: test-cluster<br />CASSANDRA_SEEDS: cassandra-1</pre><p><strong>CDC Applications</strong></p><p>With docker ps I can see that the cluster is running, also at /tmp/cdc there are data directories for both Cassandra containers. I need to start the listener app, once for each Cassandra container. The prepared configuration files are in the config directory.</p><p>Beware that bootstrap-servers properties in reader-1.yml and reader-2.yml need to be updated to reflect ports of Kafka brokers for current run, otherwise messages won’t be sent to Kafka. The following commands will start the application twice:</p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">java -jar -Dcassandra.config=file://&lt;path_to_cassandra-cdc&gt;/config/cassandra-1-cdc-tmp.yaml -Dcassandra.storagedir=file:///tmp/cdc/cassandra-1/ &lt;path_to_cassandra-cdc&gt;/target/cassandra-cdc-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar &lt;path_to_cassandra-cdc&gt;/config/reader-1.yml</pre><pre class=\"csharpcode\">java -jar -Dcassandra.config=file://&lt;path_to_cassandra-cdc&gt;/config/cassandra-2-cdc-tmp.yaml -Dcassandra.storagedir=file:///tmp/cdc/cassandra-2/ &lt;path_to_cassandra-cdc&gt;/target/cassandra-cdc-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar &lt;path_to_cassandra-cdc&gt;/config/reader-2.yml</pre><p>Now that everything is set, it just needs to be verified by a test.</p><p><strong>Testing</strong></p><p>For testing, <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/berserker\" target=\"_blank\">Berserker</a> 0.0.7 with the following configuration will do the trick.</p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">load-generator-configuration<br />data-source-configuration-name: Ranger<br />rate-generator-configuration-name: ConstantRateGenerator<br />worker-configuration-name: Cassandra<br />metrics-reporter-configuration-nae: JMX<br />thread-count: 10<br />queue-capacity: 100000data-source-configuration:<br />values:<br />genre: random(['horror', 'comedy', 'action', 'sci-fi', 'drama', 'thriller'])<br />year: random(1980..2017)<br />rating: random(float(5.5)..float(9.5))<br />duration: random(1..150)<br />title: random(['Jurassic World', 'Toy Story', 'Deadpool', 'Gravity', 'The Matrix'])<br />director: random(['Philippe Falardeau', 'Martin Scorsese', 'Steven Spilberg', 'Ridley Scott'])<br />insert: string(\"INSERT INTO movies_by_genre (genre, year, rating, duration, title, director) VALUES ('{}', {}, {}, {}, '{}', '{}');\", $genre, $year, $rating, $duration, $title, $director)<br />deleteRow: string(\"DELETE FROM movies_by_genre WHERE genre = '{}' AND year = {} AND rating = {} and duration = {};\", $genre, $year, $rating, $duration)<br />deletePartition: string(\"DELETE FROM movies_by_genre WHERE genre = '{}' AND year = {};\", $genre, $year)<br />statement:<br />consistencyLevel: ONE<br />query: random([$insert, $deleteRow, $deletePartition])<br />output: $statementrate-generator-configuration:<br />rate: 1000worker-configuration:<br />connection-points: 0.0.0.0:32821,0.0.0.0:32823<br />keyspace: custom<br />async: false<br />bootstrap-commands:<br />- \"CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS custom WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 2};<br />- USE custom;<br />- CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS movies_by_genre (title text, genre text, year int, rating float, duration int, director text, country text, PRIMARY KEY ((genre, year), rating, duration)) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (rating DESC, duration ASC) and cdc = true;metrics-reporter-configuration:<br />domain: berserker<br />filter:</pre><p>Note the connection-points value, ports need to reflect Cassandra containers.</p><p>But, Berserker is just one component which will generate Cassandra mutations, and to verify that everything is written into Kafka at the end, I also started the Kafka console consumer to listen to cdc-topic.</p><p>After a while, JSON messages will start to appear in the Kafka console. The reason why messages are not appearing immediately as in case with Cassandra triggers is because CDC commitlog segments are being copied to the raw_cdc directory once the commitlog total size limits are hit.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Besides not being immediate as Cassandra triggers are, CDC also does not guarantee order in a way. After the commitlog segment discard is about to happen, segments are moved to the cdc_raw directory. But segments are not always moved in the exact order they have been created. Some segments are left in the commitlog directory for a while. Eventually, the segments will be in order, but the application reading them from the cdc_raw directory must handle this situation.</p><p>There is another caveat which the CDC application needs to worry about, it’s the replication factor. CDC will end up in commitlog of every replica node. Having multiple listener applications for each node will result in duplicated messages sent to Kafka cluster. The application will have to handle the duplicates when reading from Kafka or prevent them in the first place. This can sometimes be handled by Kafka’s log compaction.</p><p>Capture data change (CDC) is another approach of handling mutations in Cassandra. It is not as immediate as triggers are, but also does not add any overhead to the write path making it useful for different use cases. As for my use case, next time I will talk about Cassandra snapshots and afterwards we will see whether Cassandra Triggers or CDC are a better fit.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>I’ve wanted to create a system which in its core uses event sourcing for quite a while - actually since I’ve read Martin Kleppmann’s <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/data/free/stream-processing.csp\" target=\"_blank\">Making Sense of Stream Processing</a>. The book is really amazing, Martin tends to explain all concepts from basic building blocks and in a really simple and understandable way. I recommend it to everyone.</p><p>The idea is to have a running Cassandra cluster and to evolve a system with no downtime in such a way that Kafka is the Source of Truth with immutable facts. Every other system (in this case Cassandra cluster) should use these facts and aggregate / transform them for its purpose. Also, since all facts are in Kafka, it should be easy to drop the whole database, index, cache or any other data system and recreate it from scratch again.</p><p>The following diagrams should illustrate the system evolution.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.smartcat.io/media/1359/starting-architecture.png?width=341&amp;height=243\" alt=\"\" data-udi=\"umb://media/dd373f3e90d34fe89de279c1aa0d2542\" /></p><p>Starting system architecture</p><p><img src=\"https://www.smartcat.io/media/1360/target-architecture.png?width=341&amp;height=243\" alt=\"\" data-udi=\"umb://media/069d0a53b9e84ecb9a6f84f23ecff872\" /></p><p>Target system architecture</p><p>When observing the diagrams, it seems like a pretty straightforward and trivial thing to do, but there’s more to it, especially when you want to do it with no downtime.</p><p><strong>Evolution breakdown</strong></p><p>I tried to break down the evolution process to a few conceptual steps and this is what I came up with: </p><p><strong>1. Have a mechanism to push each Cassandra change to Kafka with timestamp</strong></p><p><strong>2. Start collecting each Cassandra change to temporary Kafka topic</strong></p><p>I need to start collecting before a snapshot is taken, otherwise there will be a time window in which incoming changes would be lost, and it also needs to go to temporary topic since there is data in the database which should be first in an ordered sequence of events.</p><p><strong>3. Take the existing database snapshot</strong></p><p>This one is pretty straightforward. </p><p><strong>4. Start reading data from the snapshot into the right Kafka topic</strong></p><p>Since the data from the snapshot was created first, it should be placed first into Kafka.</p><p><strong>5. After the snapshot is read, redirect the data from the temporary Kafka topic to the right Kafka topic, but mind the timestamp when the snapshot is taken</strong></p><p>This step is essential to be done correctly, and could be considered as the hardest part. Since change event collecting started before the snapshot, there is a possibility that some events also exist in the snapshot as well and, to avoid inconsistencies, each event should be idempotent and I should try to be as precise as possible when comparing the event timestamp with the snapshot timestamp.</p><p><strong>6. Create a new Cassandra cluster/keyspace/table and Kafka stream to read from Kafka and insert into this new Cassandra cluster/keyspace/table</strong></p><p>As a result, the new cassandra cluster should be practically a copy/clone of the existing one.</p><p><strong>7. Wait for the temporary Kafka topic to deplete</strong></p><p>If I change the application to read from the new cassandra right away, and Kafka temporary topic still doesn’t catch up with system, there will be significant read delays (performance penalties) in the system. To make sure everything is in order, I think monitoring of time to propagate the change to the new Cassandra cluster will help and if the number is decent (a few milliseconds), I can proceed to the next step.</p><p><strong>8. Change the application to read from the new cassandra instead of old and still write to old</strong></p><p>Since everything is done within the no downtime context, the application is actually several instances of application on different nodes, and they won’t be changed simultaneously, that would cause the downtime. I’d need to change one at a time, while others are still having the old software version. For this reason, the application still needs to write to the old cassandra, since other application nodes are still reading from the old cassandra.</p><p><strong>9. When each application instance is updated, change the application to write directly to Kafka right topic</strong></p><p>Now each node, one by one, can be updated with new application version which will write directly to Kafka. In parallel, old nodes will write to the old Cassandra which will propagate to Kafka topic, and new nodes will write directly to the Kafka topic. When the change is complete, all nodes are writing directly to the Kafka topic and we are good to go.</p><p><strong>10. Clean up</strong></p><p>At this point, the system writes to the right Kafka topic, the stream is reading from it and making inserts into the new Cassandra. The old Cassandra and Kafka temporary topic are no longer necessary so it should be safe for me to remove them.</p><p>Well, that’s the plan, so we’ll see whether it is doable or not. </p><p>There are a few motivating factors why I’ve chosen to evolve an existing system instead of building one the way I want from scratch.</p><ol><li>It is more challenging, hence more fun.</li>\n<li>The need for evolving existing systems is the everyday job of software developers; you don’t get a chance to build a system for a starting set of requirements with guarantee that nothing in it will ever change (except for a college project, perhaps).</li>\n<li>When a system needs to change, you can choose two ways, to build a new one from scratch and when ready replace the old or to evolve the existing. I’ve done the former a few times in my life, and it might seem as fun at the beginning, but it takes awfully long, with a lot of bug fixing, often ends up as a catastrophe and is always expensive.</li>\n<li>Evolving a system takes small changes with more control, instead of placing a totally new system instead of the old.</li>\n<li>I’m a fan of Martin Fowler’s blog, <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html\" target=\"_blank\">Evolutionary Database Design</a> fits particularly nicely in this topic.</li>\n</ol><p>Since writing about this in a single post would render quite a huge post, I’ve decided to split it into a few, I’m still not sure how many, but I’ll start and see where it takes me. Bear with me.</p><p><strong>Data model</strong></p><p>I’ll start with data model. Actually, it is just one simple table, but it should be enough to demonstrate the idea. The following CQL code describes the table.</p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS movies_by_genre (<br />title text,<br />genre text,<br />year int,<br />rating float,<br />duration int,<br />director text,<br />country text,<br />PRIMARY KEY ((genre, year), rating, duration)<br />) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (rating DESC, duration ASC)</pre><p>The use case for this table might not be that common, since the table is actually designed to have a complex primary key with at least two columns as a partition key and at least two clustering columns. The reason for that is it will leverage examples, since handling of a complex primary key might be needed for someone reading this.</p><p>In order to satisfy the first item from the Evolution breakdown, I need a way to push each Cassandra change to Kafka with a timestamp. There are a few ways to do it: Cassandra Triggers, Cassandra CDC, Cassandra Custom Secondary Index and possibly some other ways, but I’ll investigate only the three mentioned.</p><p><strong>Cassandra Triggers</strong></p><p>For this approach I’ll use two Cassandra 3.11.0 nodes, two Kafka 0.10.1.1 nodes and one Zookeeper 3.4.6. Every node will run in a separate Docker container. I decided to use Docker since it keeps my machine clean and it is easy to recreate infrastructure.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">To create a trigger in Cassandra, ITrigger interface needs to be implemented. The interface itself is pretty simple:</p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">public interface ITrigger {public Collection&lt;Mutation&gt; augment(Partition update);<br />}</pre><p dir=\"ltr\">And that’s all there is to it. The interface has been changed since Cassandra 3.0. Earlier versions of Cassandra used the following interface:</p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">public interface ITrigger {public Collection&lt;Mutation&gt; augment(ByteBuffer partitionKey, ColumnFamily update);<br />}</pre><p>Before I dive into implementation, let’s discuss the interface a bit more. There are several important points regarding the implementation that need to be honored and those points are explained on the interface’s javadoc:</p><ol><li>Implementation of this interface should only have a constructor without parameters</li>\n<li>ITrigger implementation can be instantiated multiple times during the server life time. (Depends on the number of times the trigger folder is updated.)</li>\n<li>ITrigger implementation should be stateless (avoid dependency on instance variables).</li>\n</ol><p>Besides that, augment method is called exactly once per update and Partition object contains all relevant information about the update. You might notice that return type is not void but rather a collection of mutations. This way trigger can be implemented to perform some additional changes when certain criteria are met. But since I just want to propagate data to Kafka, I’ll just read the update information, send it to Kafka and return empty mutation collection. In order not to pollute this article with a huge amount of code, I’ve created maven project which creates a JAR file, and the project can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-kafka-connector/tree/master/cassandra-trigger\">here</a>.</p><p>I’ll try to explain the code in the project. Firstly, there is a FILE_PATH constant, which points to /etc/cassandra/triggers/KafkaTrigger.yml and this is where YAML configuration for trigger class needs to be. It should contain configuration options for Kafka brokers and for topic name. The file is pretty simple, since the whole file contains just the following two lines:</p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">bootstrap.servers: cluster_kafka_1:9092,cluster_kafka_2:9092&#13;\ntopic.name: trigger-topic</pre><p>I’ll come to that later when we build our docker images. Next, there is a constructor which initializes the Kafka producer and ThreadPoolExecutor. I could have done it without ThreadPoolExecutor, but the reason for it is that the trigger augment call is on Cassandra’s write path and in that way it impacts Cassandra’s write performances. To minimize that, I’ve moved trigger execution to background thread. This is doable in this case, since I am not making any mutations, I can just start the execution in another thread and return an empty list of mutations immediately. In case when the trigger needs to make a mutation based on partition changes, that would need to happen in the same thread.</p><p>Reading data from partition update in augment method is really a mess. Cassandra API is not that intuitive and I went through a real struggle to read all the necessary information. There are a few different ways to update a partition in Cassandra, and these are ones I’ve covered:</p><ol><li>Insert</li>\n<li>Update</li>\n<li>Delete of director column</li>\n<li>Delete of title column</li>\n<li>Delete of both director and title columns</li>\n<li>Delete of row</li>\n<li>Delete range of rows for last clustering column (duration between some values)</li>\n<li>Delete all rows for specific rating clustering column</li>\n<li>Delete range of rows for first clustering column (rating between some values)</li>\n<li>Delete whole partition</li>\n</ol><p>A simplified algorithm would be: </p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">if (isPartitionDeleted(partition)) {<br />handle partition delete;<br />} else {<br />if (isRowUpdated(partition)) {<br />if (isRowDeleted(partition)) {<br />handle row delete;<br />} else {<br />if (isCellDeleted(partition)) {<br />handle cell delete;<br />} else {<br />handle upsert;<br />}<br />}<br />} else if (isRangeDelete(partition)) {<br />handle range delete;<br />}<br />}</pre><p>In each case, JSON is generated and sent to Kafka. Each message contains enough information to recreate Cassandra CQL query from it.</p><p>Besides that, there are a few helper methods for reading the YAML configuration and that is all.</p><p>In order to test everything, I’ve chosen Docker, as stated earlier. I’m using <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://hub.docker.com/_/cassandra/\" target=\"_blank\">Cassandra</a> docker image with 3.11.0 tag. But since the JAR file and KafkaTrigger.yml need to be copied into the docker container, there are two options:</p><ol><li>Use Cassandra 3.11.0 image and docker cp command to copy the files into the container</li>\n<li>Create a new Docker image with files already in it and use that image</li>\n</ol><p>The first option is not an option actually, it is not in the spirit of Docker to do such thing so I will go with the second option.</p><p>Create a cluster directory somewhere and a cassandra directory within it</p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">mkdir -p cluster/cassandra</pre><p>cluster directory will be needed for later, now just create KafkaTrigger.yml in cassandra dir with the content I provided earlier. Also, the built JAR file (cassandra-trigger-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar) needs to be copied here. To build all that into Docker, I created a Dockerfile with the following content:</p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">FROM cassandra:3.11.0<br />COPY KafkaTrigger.yml /etc/cassandra/triggers/KafkaTrigger.yml<br />COPY cassandra-trigger-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar /etc/cassandra/triggers/trigger.jar<br />CMD [\"cassandra\", \"-f\"]</pre><p>In console, just position yourself in the cassandra directory and run:</p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">docker build -t trigger-cassandra .</pre><p>That will create a docker image with name trigger-cassandra.</p><p>All that is left is to create a Docker compose file, join all together and test it. The Docker compose file should be placed in the  cluster directory. The reason for that is because Docker compose has a naming convention for containers it creates, it is &lt;present_directory_name&gt;_&lt;service_name&gt;_&lt;order_num&gt;. And I already specified the Kafka domain names in KafkaTrigger.yml as cluster_kafka_1 and cluster_kafka_2, in case the Docker compose is run from another location, container naming would change and KafkaTrigger.yml would need to be updated.</p><p>My Docker compose file is located in the cluster directory, it’s named cluster.yml and it looks like this:</p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">version: '3.3'<br />services:<br />zookeeper:<br />image: wurstmeister/zookeeper:3.4.6<br />ports:<br />- \"2181:2181\"<br />kafka:<br />image: wurstmeister/kafka:0.10.1.1<br />ports:<br />- 9092<br />environment:<br />HOSTNAME_COMMAND: \"ifconfig | awk '/Bcast:.+/{print $$2}' | awk -F\\\":\\\" '{print $$2}'\"<br />KAFKA_ADVERTISED_PORT: 9092<br />KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181<br />cassandra-seed:<br />image: trigger-cassandra<br />ports:<br />- 7199<br />- 9042<br />environment:<br />CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME: test-cluster<br />cassandra:<br />image: trigger-cassandra<br />ports:<br />- 7199<br />- 9042<br />environment:<br />CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME: test-cluster<br />CASSANDRA_SEEDS: cassandra-seed</pre><p>The cluster contains the definition for Zookeeper, Kafka and Cassandra with the exception that there are two Cassandra services. The reason for that is that one can be standalone, but all others need a seed list. cassandra-seed will serve as seed, and cassandra as scalable service. That way, I can start multiple instances of cassandra. However, to start multiple instances, it takes time, and it is not recommended to have multiple Cassandra nodes in joining state. So, scale should be done one node at a time. That does not apply to Kafka nodes. With the following command, I’ve got a running cluster ready for use:</p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">docker-compose -f cluster.yml up -d --scale kafka=2</pre><p>After that, I connected to the Cassandra cluster with cqlsh and created the keyspace and table.</p><p>To add a trigger to the table, you need to execute the following command:</p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">CREATE TRIGGER kafka_trigger ON movies_by_genre USING 'io.smartcat.cassandra.trigger.KafkaTrigger';</pre><p>In case you get the following error:</p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">ConfigurationException: Trigger class 'io.smartcat.cassandra.trigger.KafkaTrigger' doesn't exist</pre><p>There are several things that can be wrong. The JAR file might not be loaded within the Cassandra node; that should happen automatically, but if it doesn’t you can try to load it with:</p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">nodetool reloadTriggers</pre><p>If the problem persists, it might be that the configuration file is not at a proper location, but that can only happen if you are using a different infrastructure setup and you forgot to copy KafkaTrigger.yml to the proper location. Cassandra will show the same error even if class is found but there is some problem instantiating it or casting it to theITrigger interface. Also, make sure that you implemented the ITrigger interface from the right Cassandra version (versions of cassandra in the JAR file and of the cassandra node should match).</p><p>If there are no errors, the trigger is created properly. This can be checked by executing the following CQL commands:</p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">USE system_schema;<br />SELECT * FROM triggers;</pre><p><strong>Results</strong></p><p>I used kafka-console-consumer to see if messages end up in Kafka, but any other option is good enough. Here are a few things I tried and the results it gave me:</p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">-- insert<br />INSERT INTO movies_by_genre (genre, year, rating, duration, title, director) VALUES ('drama', 2015, 7.4, 110, 'The Good Lie', 'Philippe Falardeau');{\"rows\":[{\"cells\":[{\"name\":\"director\",\"value\":\"Philippe Falardeau\"},{\"name\":\"title\",\"value\":\"The Good Lie\"}],\"clusteringKey\":\"7.4, 110\"}],\"key\":\"drama:2015\"}-- update<br />UPDATE movies_by_genre SET title = 'a' WHERE genre = 'drama' AND year = 2015 AND rating = 7.4 AND duration = 110;{\"rows\":[{\"cells\":[{\"name\":\"title\",\"value\":\"a\"}],\"clusteringKey\":\"7.4, 110\"}],\"key\":\"drama:2015\"}-- delete of director column<br />DELETE director FROM movies_by_genre WHERE genre = 'drama' AND year = 2015 AND rating = 7.4 AND duration = 110;{\"rows\":[{\"cells\":[{\"deleted\":true,\"name\":\"director\"}],\"clusteringKey\":\"7.4, 110\"}],\"key\":\"drama:2015\"}-- delete of title column<br />DELETE title FROM movies_by_genre WHERE genre = 'drama' AND year = 2015 AND rating = 7.4 AND duration = 110;{\"rows\":[{\"cells\":[{\"deleted\":true,\"name\":\"title\"}],\"clusteringKey\":\"7.4, 110\"}],\"key\":\"drama:2015\"}-- delete of both director and title columns<br />DELETE title, director FROM movies_by_genre WHERE genre = 'drama' AND year = 2015 AND rating = 7.4 AND duration = 110;{\"rows\":[{\"cells\":[{\"deleted\":true,\"name\":\"director\"},{\"deleted\":true,\"name\":\"title\"}],\"clusteringKey\":\"7.4, 110\"}],\"key\":\"drama:2015\"}-- delete of row<br />DELETE FROM movies_by_genre WHERE genre = 'drama' AND year = 2015 AND rating = 7.4 AND duration = 110;{\"rowDeleted\":true,\"rows\":[{\"clusteringKey\":\"7.4, 110\"}],\"key\":\"drama:2015\"}-- delete range of rows for last clustering column (duration between some values) <br />DELETE FROM movies_by_genre WHERE genre = 'drama' AND year = 2015 AND rating = 7.4 AND duration &gt; 90;                    {\"rowRangeDeleted\":true,\"start\":[{\"clusteringKey\":\"7.4\"},{\"inclusive\":false,\"clusteringKey\":\"90\"}],\"end\":[{\"inclusive\":true,\"clusteringKey\":\"7.4\"}],\"rows\":[],\"key\":\"drama:2015\"}-- delete range of rows for last clustering column (duration between some values) <br />DELETE FROM movies_by_genre WHERE genre = 'drama' AND year = 2015 AND rating = 7.4 AND duration &lt; 90;{\"rowRangeDeleted\":true,\"start\":[{\"inclusive\":true,\"clusteringKey\":\"7.4\"}],\"end\":[{\"clusteringKey\":\"7.4\"},{\"inclusive\":false,\"clusteringKey\":\"90\"}],\"rows\":[],\"key\":\"drama:2015\"}-- delete range of rows for last clustering column (duration between some values) <br />DELETE FROM movies_by_genre WHERE genre = 'drama' AND year = 2015 AND rating = 7.4 AND duration &gt; 90 AND duration &lt;= 120;{\"rowRangeDeleted\":true,\"start\":[{\"clusteringKey\":\"7.4\"},{\"inclusive\":false,\"clusteringKey\":\"90\"}],\"end\":[{\"clusteringKey\":\"7.4\"},{\"inclusive\":true,\"clusteringKey\":\"120\"}],\"rows\":[],\"key\":\"drama:2015\"}-- delete all rows for specific rating clustering column<br />DELETE FROM movies_by_genre WHERE genre = 'drama' AND year = 2015 AND rating = 7.4;     {\"rowRangeDeleted\":true,\"start\":[{\"inclusive\":true,\"clusteringKey\":\"7.4\"}],\"end\":[{\"inclusive\":true,\"clusteringKey\":\"7.4\"}],\"rows\":[],\"key\":\"drama:2015\"}-- delete range of rows for first clustering column (rating between some values)<br />DELETE FROM movies_by_genre WHERE genre = 'drama' AND year = 2015 AND rating &gt;= 7.5 AND rating &lt;  9.0;{\"rowRangeDeleted\":true,\"start\":[{\"inclusive\":false,\"clusteringKey\":\"9.0\"}],\"end\":[{\"inclusive\":true,\"clusteringKey\":\"7.5\"}],\"rows\":[],\"key\":\"drama:2015\"}-- delete whole partition<br />DELETE FROM movies_by_genre WHERE genre = 'drama' AND year = 2015;{\"partitionDeleted\":true,\"key\":\"drama:2015\"}</pre><p>For most cases, not all of these mutations are used, usually it’s just insert, update and one kind of delete. Here I intentionally tried several ways since it might come in handy to someone. In case you have a simpler table use case, you might be able to simplify the trigger code as well.</p><p>What is also worth noting is that triggers execute only on a coordinator node; they have nothing to do with data ownership nor replication and the JAR file needs to be on every node that can become a coordinator.</p><p><strong>Going a step further</strong></p><p>This is OK for testing purposes, but for this experiment to have any value, I will simulate the mutations to the cassandra cluster at some rate. This can be accomplished in several ways, writing a custom small application, using cassandra stress or using some other tool. Here at SmartCat, we have developed a tool for such purpose. That is the easiest way for me to create load on a Cassandra cluster. The tool is called <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/smartcat-labs/berserker\" target=\"_blank\">Berserker</a>, you can give it a try.</p><p>To start with Berserker, I’ve downloaded the latest version (0.0.7 is the latest at the moment of writing) from <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://bintray.com/smartcat-labs/maven/download_file?file_path=io%2Fsmartcat%2Fberserker-runner%2F0.0.7%2Fberserker-runner-0.0.7.jar\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.

It would have routing value.\nYou can set this value in your application code with a ttl may be 5 minutes.</p>\n<p>PS : This is all done for optimizing fetching of routing value. You can ignore this completely and still trigger would work.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"user-content-just-for-fun\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#just-for-fun\"></a>Just for fun</h2>\n<p>Incase your elasticsearch/other database is down or not working, it sends the message(with data) to rabbitmq server. You can run a rabbitmq consumer to read the data from queue and insert it into elasticsearch.\nIncase you don't need that functionality just comment out function 'queueMessage' from ElasticQueue.java file.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"user-content-general-tip\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#general-tip\"></a>General Tip</h2>\n<p>For all the updates in cassandra, we get value of primary key and clustering key in trigger code and the updated column and its value.\nSo, whenever creating a table in cassandra, try to keep routing key(of the corresponding index in elasticsearch) part of primary key or cluster key as you would require routing key when updating document in ES.</p>\n<p>For eg.\nCassandra Table Structure :\nuser_post (userid, postid, text, somecol) with primary key userid and clustering key as postid.</p>\n<p>Corresponding ES Index :\n'user_post' with routing userid or postid as you would get these values in your cassandra trigger directly. In case you would have kept 'somecol' as routing key, then you would need to query ES for value of 'somecol' which would make write slow.</p>\n</article>",

Cassandra database. The features that are important to you will influence how you design, size, and configure your Cassandra cluster.For Rack and Datacenter awareness, mention that includes deploying Cassandra in the cloud, such as Amazon EC2, Rackspace, Google Computing Cloud, etc.This should be self-explanatory for me as I go through this slideSince Cassandra is linearly scalable, your cluster can be scaled as large as needed. The focus for this presentation is more on the minimum number of nodes you’d want / need, alongwith the replication setting.Based on data from a University of Toronto studyhttp://vldb.org/pvldb/vol5/p1724_tilmannrabl_vldb2012.pdfReplication needed to achieve high availability when designing for failure.Can’t have replication factor larger than number of nodes in the cluster.Wait, there are people that didn’t understand what a rack or datacenter is?  Well then, let’s backtrack a little and define some of these terms. Starting with the smallest unit, we have the node…By process, I mean a Java virtual machine. Cassandra is written in Java, and its binary code must run in a virtual machine.Nodes can also be represented as a cloud or virtual server instance.Datacenters can be geographically separated, but also logically separated as well. Additional use cases for data centers include disaster recovery and workload seperation. With single node databases when you write data, you can expect to read back the same data. It’s not so easy with distributed systems though. The node that a client writes data to may not be the same node another client is trying to read the data from. In that case, a distributed system must implement a consistency model to determine when written data is saved to the relevant nodes. May want to mention BASE, make sure to clarify that eventual consistency usually occurs within milliseconds (thanks Netflix!)Tunable consistency is a key feature of Cassandra, and the type of consistency you want to use may affect your cluster design.Be sure to explain what happens if data returned from each node does not match.Be sure to explain what happens if data returned from each node does not match.Cross-datacenter latency vs. local consistency / consistency across datacentersImportant to understand how the storage engine works, since that directly impacts data size.  No reads before a write.Writes go to commit log for durability, and memtablePeriodically memtable data is flushed to disk into a SSTable, or sorted strings table. This will destroy the memtable so that the memory can be reused. Relevant commitlog entries also marked as cleared.Important to understand how the storage engine works, since that directly impacts data size.Important to understand how the storage engine works, since that directly impacts data size.Now that you have a basic understanding of how Cassandra works and the possible benefits to select and use, we can talk about the primary factors for sizing your database.Although not as key, I will also discuss some considerations for the replication factor as wellIf RF = 1, we are not making use of Cassandra’s advantages of being available. One node = single point of failure.If just using Cassandra for durability, may use RF=2 just to ensure we have two copies of your data on separate nodes.Next slide will talk a bit more about RF &amp;lt; 3.PerformanceFor high availability use cases, there are clusters configured to use a replication factor as high as 5. Not very common.Each Cassandra node has a certain data capacity, and out of that capacity it can only be used for data to a certain limit. These are some of the factors.Of course your data set needs to be accounted for. In addition there is overhead for writing the data in Cassandra, as well as certain structures used for read optimizations (Partition index, summary, Bloom filter)If using a RF &amp;gt; 1, must account for those additional copies. At RF=3, if your data set is 5TB it means C* will be saving 15TB.One consequence of log structured storage is that data that’s no longer needed will exist until a compaction will clean it up. That means additional space remains used until a compaction occurs.Free disk space must be reserved for compaction so that data can be merged into a new file. See above.Backing up your data is very easy with Cassandra. Since the data files are immutable, a snapshot can be taken which creates a hard link or copy of the relevant SSTables. Hard links in particular are pretty much zero cost, since it takes negligible disk space and time to create the hard link.However just be careful. If you are creating snapshots, or configured Cassandra to automatically create snapshots, that’s also going to eat up your disk space unless user does housekeeping.DataStax recommended disk capacity, size your cluster so that your data fits.Why can’t we just add more disks? Limited by performance of each node handling that much data (contention from reads/writes, flushing, compaction, limit on JVM heap memory allocation).For cluster sizing, you want to have enough nodes so that read and write performance meet any SLAs, or are otherwise acceptable to users.Failure conditions must also be taken into account. If a node fails, the workload from that node must be absorbed by the other nodes in the cluster. When recovering the node, this can result in further impact to performance.Don’t size cluster to fully utilize each node, leave room so that cluster can still perform acceptably during failure.Rule of thumb: Some Cassandra MVPs recommend having no less than 6 nodes in your cluster. With less than 6, if you lose one node, you lose a good chunk of your cluster’s throughput capability (at least 20%).</div></div></div><div class=\"notranslate transcript add-padding-right j-transcript\"><ol class=\"j-transcripts transcripts no-bullet no-style\" itemprop=\"text\"><li>\n      1.\n    How To Size Up A Cassandra Cluster\nJoe Chu, Technical Trainer\njchu@datastax.com\nApril 2014\n©2014 DataStax Confidential.

        "title": "Cassandra Node Lessons Learned: Right-Sizing Cassandra Clusters",
        "url": "https://robinsystems.com/blog/lessons-learned-cassandra/",
        "content": "<p>“So what”, you say, “Why should I care if that cluster had such low hardware utilization? I’m sure mine’s fine.”</p><p>Here’s why you should care: This kind of thing happens all the time in the Cassandra world. At the time of that conversation, I had two other customers struggling with the same challenge, a large chip maker, and a network equipment manufacturer.</p><p>There are many variations of how and why this happens. You just might be unknowingly wasting CapEx and leaving a ton of scalability on the table with your Cassandra clusters.</p><h3><strong>Here’s the reality check:</strong></h3><p>My customers needed to deploy a different number of Cassandra software nodes than the number of physical host servers they had available. But they didn’t have a way to do it that was feasible for them.</p><p>What my customers really needed was the ability to deploy scenarios like 52 Cassandra nodes on 23 host servers, or maybe 17 nodes on 11 servers, or possibly 500 nodes on as few servers as possible to keep their hardware costs down for such a large cluster.</p><p>How does this happen? Because you optimize the number of server hosts and Cassandra nodes separately.</p><ul><li><strong>Host Count</strong>: Provision host server capacity based on the best economics you can get from your IT or Purchasing for gear that meets or exceeds the Cassandra minimum server specifications. Current best practice is to get enough servers to handle the aggregate peak workload or data set size, whichever is the limiter in your use case.</li>\n<li><strong>Cassandra Node Count</strong>: You really need to size your Cassandra software nodes and determine your cluster node count based on testing before you go to production. Sizing Cassandra before you’re in production is a both art and science. It’s hard. You can guestimate through calculations. But sizing calculators are usually not effective. Luckily for you, Cassandra scales linearly. You can test a small cluster and then arrive at your total cluster node count by dividing your aggregate workload or data size by the capacity of each node (from your tests). Don’t forget to factor in replication and multi-DC.</li>\n</ul><p>Chances are slim to none the boxes available to you are exactly the right size for a single Cassandra node. Most of my Cassandra customers had no choice but to use servers that were significantly over the minimum Cassandra server requirements. So they tried to over-size their Cassandra node density to get the most out of their servers. That’s a path proven to be fraught with pain.</p><p>As your workloads and data sizes change over time, the node:host mismatch is exacerbated. But that’s a topic for another day and another blog post…</p><h3><strong>**Here’s how we get to the sizing of 3 Cassandra nodes per box based on current practices with Cassandra 3.x:</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Storage</strong> – Under a write or read/write workload each Cassandra node does its own back end garbage collecting and flushing that causes a lot of storage IO. Under heavy write workload and tuned well, it will be compacting almost constantly without falling too far behind, if at all. This means the amount of data you can put on a Cassandra node is often IO bound. Think: max of ~1.5TB for HDD and ~4-5TB for SSD. Because there are many variables that factor in how much data you can fit on a Cassandra node while meeting your SLAs, you will want to load test this with your own data model, access patterns with realistic payload sizes, client code, driver setup, hardware stack, etc, before deciding your production data density per node.</li>\n<li><strong>Cores</strong> – A single Cassandra node under max load recruits maybe ~12 cores. That 12 cores is not a hard limit. It’s a ballpark before diminishing returns set in. Yes, I’m generalizing here and not hitting all the permutations. It’s still valid. <a href=\"https://medium.com/@foundev/data-density-destroyer-of-scalability-a14282aeed66\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8 cores is a good sweet spot for a moderate sized yet very capable node</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Memory</strong> – The Cassandra JVM heap can only be so big before you start to get in GC trouble. Buffer cache will take as much memory as you throw at it, which is good for read-heavy workloads. But the cache benefit might not be there for a write or mixed read/write workload. 42GB is fine for 8 cores and reasonable data density per node.</li>\n</ul>",

This decision has been taken because a lot of <a href=\"http://cassandra.apache.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apache Cassandra®</a> metrics are expensive to scrap and can hinder the performance of the node.\nAs we don't want this kind of situation to happen in production, the scrape frequency is restricted via the configuration of Cassandra Exporter.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/85f8e6b503fc834c4127aa556d8d941c29b8a1ab/68747470733a2f2f67726166616e612e636f6d2f6170692f64617368626f617264732f363235382f696d616765732f333939362f696d616765\"><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/85f8e6b503fc834c4127aa556d8d941c29b8a1ab/68747470733a2f2f67726166616e612e636f6d2f6170692f64617368626f617264732f363235382f696d616765732f333939362f696d616765\" alt=\"Grafana\" data-canonical-src=\"https://grafana.com/api/dashboards/6258/images/3996/image\" /></a>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e9d40a59216424e2a99d8641461c4299925ea44a/68747470733a2f2f67726166616e612e636f6d2f6170692f64617368626f617264732f363430302f696d616765732f343131312f696d616765\"><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e9d40a59216424e2a99d8641461c4299925ea44a/68747470733a2f2f67726166616e612e636f6d2f6170692f64617368626f617264732f363430302f696d616765732f343131312f696d616765\" alt=\"Grafana\" data-canonical-src=\"https://grafana.com/api/dashboards/6400/images/4111/image\" /></a></p>\n<h2><a id=\"user-content-how-to-use\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#how-to-use\"></a>How to use</h2>\n<p>To start the application</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>java -jar cassandra_exporter.jar config.yml</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Cassandra exporter needs to run on every Cassandra nodes to get all the informations regarding the whole cluster.</p>\n<p>You can have a look at a full configuration file <a href=\"https://github.com/criteo/cassandra_exporter/blob/master/config.yml\">here</a>\nThe 2 main parts are :</p>\n<ol><li>blacklist</li>\n<li>maxScrapFrequencyInSec</li>\n</ol><p>In the <code>blacklist</code> block, you specify the metrics you don't want the exporter to scrape. This is important as JMX is an RPC mechanism and you don't want to trigger some of those RPC.

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\">At Threat Stack our engineering and operations teams have embraced the concept of the polyglot data platform, recognizing that no one solution can provide for all of our needs. Those needs include rapid scaling, ideally linearly, to support growing customer demand and the elastic workloads of our new economy customers. We also require different forms of analysis to support stream analysis for our IDS feature set, efficient lookup tables and prematerialized views for our ETDR feature set, and offline analysis for analysis and research.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">A core component of our data platform for several years has been Cassandra, which we upgraded to Datastax Enterprise (DSE) through their start up program last year. Originally we were expecting to use it as our single source of truth for all of our time series data, but this turned out to be an anti pattern. Instead we have found it very useful for look up tables and pre-materialized views (more on this later).</p>\n<p>Our initial Cassandra cluster was three i2.2xlarge nodes spread across 3 Availability Zones in AWS, but within a few short months we had expanded to over thirty Cassandra nodes. At the rate at which we were taking in new data, our overall scaling strategy looked similar to this:<br /></p>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<p>The team did have extensive experience with other eventually consistent databases though, so with some advice from Datastax, Cassandra has now become one of the most stable and pleasurable components of our polyglot data platform to work with.</p>\n<p>This content has been a long time coming, so we definitely ran longer than a generally accepted blog post might. We decided to ironically embrace the chaos by providing you with a table of contents:</p>\n<ol><li><a href=\"#1\">Quick Tips</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#2\">Monitoring Gotcha and Quirks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#3\">AWS Instance Type and Disk Configuration</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#4\">Drowning Your Cluster with Multi-Tenant Tables</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#5\">Streaming Failures, JVM Tuning, and GC Woes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#6\">Schema design, or These Aren’t the Rows You’re Looking For</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#7\">Only Have 2 to 3 Seed Nodes per Data Center</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#8\">Conclusion</a></li>\n</ol><h2>1. Quick Tips</h2>\n<p>Some of these are well known, but are worth repeating.</p>\n<ul><li>Batch writes by partition key, then by batch size (5120 bytes, the Cassandra warn threshold).</li>\n<li>Don’t under staff Cassandra. This is hard as a start up, but recognize going in that it could require 1 to 2 FTEs as you ramp up, maybe more depending on how quickly you scale up. While we are able to see the benefits of this investment on the other side, it was an uncomfortable place to be in as we were also scaling up customer acquisition. </li>\n<li>Don’t adopt new versions too quickly. Minor version bumps have been known to cause havoc and new features only work roughly as expected the first time (DTCS is a great example of this). We regularly run new versions in our development environment for a month or two before promoting to production. </li>\n<li>Paradoxically, don’t fall too far behind with new versions. Sadly we have friends who are still stuck on Cassandra 1.x because of their Thrift usage. We light a candle for them. </li>\n<li>Many smaller nodes beat out fewer larger nodes. Not only does this make your dynamo quorum math more resilient to per-server failure, which is important because AWS <strong>will</strong> decommission a node in your cluster, but it decreases the mean time to recovery because you can stream data across more nodes at a cluster to achieve higher aggregate data transfer rates. </li>\n<li>Budget days to bring a node into the cluster. If you’ve vertically scaled, then it will take over a week. Regardless you will want to uncap streaming and compaction throughput with nodetool.  You’ll take a slight performance hit, but it’s worth it to finish node streaming in a reasonable time. This is another good reason why you want to run more smaller sized instances with less data per system. </li>\n<li>Don’t use hinted handoffs (ANY or LOCAL_ANY quorum). In fact, just disable them in the configuration. It’s too easy to lose data during a prolonged outage or load spike, and if a node went down because of the load spike you’re just going to pass the problem around the ring, eventually taking multiple or all nodes down. We never experienced this on Cassandra, but have on other systems that supported hinted handoffs.</li>\n</ul><h2>2. Monitoring Gotcha and Quirks </h2>\n<p>Datastax graciously offers usage of Opscenter and the included agent for both open source Cassandra and DSE.  The setup and deployment of this is incredibly simple, and when you are a high growth start up, time is a premium.  Opscenter acted as our initial metrics source and gave us pretty high quality metrics early in our scaling time line.  Because it was easy to setup and deploy the opscenter collector agents we were able to get meaningful data without spending a lot of time on it.  </p>\n<p>A few months after we launched our service, new user sign ups increased our data ingestion by an order of magnitude within just 2 weeks.  We were over 20 Cassandra nodes by this point and ingesting a few TB per day.  Our original way of handling multi-tenancy was at the table level, essentially storing each customer’s data in their own table  (we talk more below about why this was a bad idea).  But as our customer count exploded we were creating more and more tables (we had a few per each customer).  By default the opscenter agent will collect data for all your tables to allow for some pretty awesome granular metrics capture. But when you have so many tables it turns into a lot of metrics. Which brings us to our first gotcha.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t use the same Cassandra cluster to store Opscenter metrics and application data.</strong></p>\n<p>Now – the problem is that currently using a separate cluster for metrics collection with opscenter is an Enterprise only option.  If you are lucky enough to be using DSE then <a href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/opscenter/5.1/opsc/configure/opscStoringCollectionDataDifferentCluster_t.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here is how you can set it up</a>.</p>\n<p>If you don’t have DSE you could potentially put the Opscenter data in a keyspace on nodes in a separate datacenter.  I haven’t tried that so YMMV.  For us we didn’t want to lose out on potentially valuable metrics so we sent the metrics to a separate Cassandra cluster.  The graph below of the cluster load average shows a pretty large drop when we essentially stop DDOSing our cluster with our own metrics.</p>\n<p><strong><strong> <img title=\"\" src=\"https://www.threatstack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Cassandra-graph.png\" width=\"642\" height=\"417\" alt=\"image\" /></strong></strong></p>\n<p><br />If you don’t have DSE, you can (and should)<a href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/opscenter/5.1/opsc/configure/opscExcludingKeyspaces_c.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> disable collection on specific keyspaces and column families</a>.</p>\n<p>But at this point the value of opscenter goes down quite a bit when you start nerfing functionality and metrics you’re collecting.</p>\n<h3><strong>Metrics Collection </strong></h3>\n<p>A month after launch when we had cluster issues we quickly found that Opscenter was great when the cluster was running optimally, but when the cluster has issues your visibility goes down to zero. We are a happy Librato customer and soon starting collecting additional metrics using the <a href=\"https://github.com/sensu-plugins/sensu-plugins-cassandra/blob/master/bin/metrics-cassandra-graphite.rb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sensu community plugin for Cassandra</a>.  It’s a very basic way to collect metrics by parsing nodetool status output, and didn’t require us messing around with the JMX console.</p>\n<p>Over the last few months we have built an internal high resolution metrics cluster and we wanted higher resolution metrics for Cassandra as well, so for that we moved metrics collection from Sensu over to collectd using the JMX plugin.  This has worked pretty well for us and <a href=\"https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-cassandra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SignalFX has an example</a> of how you might set that up.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Cassandra does have a <a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/pluggable-metrics-reporting-in-cassandra-2-0-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pluggable metrics reporting</a> since 2.0.0 – you can use that in order to send metrics to your local metrics cluster.  Assuming this works well we’ll likely be moving over to this to push metrics to graphite vs pulling them.</p>\n<h3><strong>Metrics that you should care about</strong></h3>\n<p>This is where the most learning about Cassandra really took place.  There are a TON of metrics available via JMX and if you can afford the storage of those metrics I’m a fan of capturing as many as possible at as high a resolution as is feasible for your environment.  </p>\n<p>You can use the JConsole in order to navigate around to see<a href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/operations/ops_monitoring_c.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> what kind of metrics exist</a>. There is some more info on the Datastax site.</p>\n<p>Additionally there is some great info on the <a href=\"http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Metrics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cassandra wiki </a>describing some of the metrics you can capture.</p>\n<p>This is <a href=\"https://lostechies.com/ryansvihla/2014/11/25/my-cassandra-diagnostics-checklist-brain-dump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one blog post in particular</a> that was helpful for me in the beginning of our Cassandra usage.</p>\n<h2>3. AWS Instance Type and Disk Configuration</h2>\n<p>The original cluster we launched on in October 2014 was built on i2.2xlarge servers (8 vCPUs, 61GB of RAM, and 2 x 800GB SSDs). While the local SSDs were a treat, especially when you had to force a hard compaction or stream data, it wasn’t cost efficient.</p>\n<p>Earlier this spring AWS launched its D2 lines of instances, which were specifically targeted at our situation of needing a large amount of locally attached storage at a low price point, without sacrificing CPU and RAM density. We rebuilt the cluster in place by replacing i2.2xlarge’s with d2.2xlarge’s, giving us the same CPU and RAM but with 6 x 2TB spinning disks. This was a time intensive process as we waited for all the data to stream, but was effectively cheaper than running two whole clusters in parallel.</p>\n<p>The other impactful change that we made was dedicating a single spinning disk to the commit log. Every operation that touches the disk sped up as a result of this. The remaining 5 disks are striped together, giving us 10TB usable or 5TB effective disk space (leaving 50% of the disk for SSTable compaction). If we were to fill the effective disk space of 5TB then node replacement would likely take days or weeks, which is too long. As a result we are deciding whether or not to double the size of the cluster on d2.xlarge’s.</p>\n<h2>4. Drowning Your Cluster with Multi-Tenant Tables</h2>\n<p>The entire Threat Stack platform is multi tenant, including the storage. Our initial implementation of tenancy on Cassandra was at the table level, allowing for logical tracking of access and growth rates per customer.</p>\n<p>However, we found that handling more than a few hundred tables was outside of Cassandra’s capabilities. Compactions would regularly fail, the Datastax read repair service never completed, and the JVM was spending far too much time tracking state. This problem scaled rapidly as we added customers because the number of tables was equal to the number of customers multiplied by the number of table types.</p>\n<p>Luckily we already had agent IDs (sensors) in the partition key which have a one-to-one relationship to organization IDs (tenants), so it was trivial to collapse down to multi tenant tables.</p>\n<p>The other benefit was that we no longer had to dynamically create new tables. This was a painful and error prone process, which if performed incorrectly could crash Cassandra if too many duplicate CREATE TABLE statements were issued.</p>\n<h2>5. Streaming Failures, JVM Tuning, and GC Woes</h2>\n<p><strong><em>*obligatory disclaimer about JVM tuning and other dark arts</em></strong></p>\n<p>When you are under a state of high growth, adding nodes quickly becomes <em>critical.  </em>When nodes fail to stream the stress level goes up about the same rate as your total available disk goes down. As our node count grew and the amount of writes per second increased, we reached a point where a few default settings caused us to be unable to stream new nodes. Prior to this point new nodes would take about 10-15 hours to fully join the cluster. Mainly because of our (incorrect) usage of per-account column families we were streaming about 70,000 SSTables to new nodes.  Part of the streaming issue was related to that, but it was compounded by some of the default settings in our Cassandra cluster.</p>\n<p><strong>Your HEAP_NEW_SIZE is probably too low</strong></p>\n<p>There were old recommendations that said 100m per CPU up to 800m total.  For us, this was not enough as the real reason nodes were unable to fully complete bootstrap and stream from other nodes was because we were hitting long GC pauses that actually timed out the stream from one or two nodes.  The most painful part is when you have (for example) 10 or 15 stream sessions going, and ONE fails, then the whole thing failed and you need to start over again.  <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-8150\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CASSANDRA-8150</a> is still one of the best tickets to review that has a bunch of additional JVM options as well, as well as newer tuning option for G1GC.</p>\n<p>You can also monitor for stream failures by grabbing the Stream Session ID in the cassandra system logs, then searching for that ID in all your logs.  If there is a failure, it will happen very quickly and you don’t have to wait a day for what will eventually be a failed bootstrapping/streaming session.</p>\n<p><strong>Increase memtable_flush_writers when you have lots of data to stream</strong></p>\n<p>The way it was described to us was that since we were streaming a lot of data from many nodes we wanted to increase the number of flush writers because the streams were all hitting the memtables. If you do not have enough writers to deal with a (larger than normal) amount of data hitting them that can cause your streams to fail.  The recommendation we were given was to set this equal to the number of CPUs on the node and it’s worked well for us.</p>\n<p><strong>streaming_socket_timeout_in_ms should be set to a non-zero number</strong></p>\n<p>Finally – we ran into this fun issues described in <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-8472\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CASSANDRA-8472</a> where stream sessions would hang and not timeout. This was after we made the changes to the heap memory amount and we’re chalking this up to odd AWS networking across AZ’s.</p>\n<p>Luckily this issue is now fixed and upgrading will solve it, but if you haven’t yet (or can’t) upgrade, then set your streaming_socket_timeout_in_ms to some non-zero number.  We set this to 1 hour, which is now coincidentally the default in the now accepted patch in <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-8611\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CASSANDRA-8611</a>.</p>\n<h2>6. Schema design, or These Aren’t the Rows You’re Looking For</h2>\n<p>The more applications we bring up on top of Cassandra, the more we find it being well suited for models that are either wide and shallow or narrow and deep. It is very similar to CouchDB’s incremental map/reduce in this way.</p>\n<p>A lot of Threat Stack’s UI requires building relationships of different types of events, which can be difficult when the underlying data model is an insert only, partially ordered, write ahead log. For example, when you view a process’s details we have to collect all of the syscall, network, TTY, login/logout, and FIM information for that single process invoke <strong>and</strong> all of its historical runs. Additionally, you could be entering that process’s context from any of those data points, not just the process start. Therefore we maintain multiple lookup tables, tracking a process’s state as it changes in milliseconds or over years (the longest running process we’ve seen is from 2011).</p>\n<p>Some examples of building wide and shallow models are sparse matrices. We have less examples of this in production today, instead driving specific widgets off pre materialized views, but plan to migrate some of the most popular lookups to this model.</p>\n<h2>7. Only Have 2 to 3 Seed Nodes per Data Center</h2>\n<p>Back in February we were seeing very odd behavior that was preventing a node from bootstrapping. This was a big concern because we were having to scale our cluster for disk utilization reasons, so time was against us.</p>\n<p>The short story is that we were hitting the bug documented in <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-5836\">CASSANDRA-5836</a>, where seed nodes were prevented from bootstrapping. The root cause for our cluster was that we were setting every node as a seed node, which is not the expected gossip configuration.</p>\n<p>We have since moved to one seed node per rack (AWS availability zone). This is technically one more than the Datastax recommended count, but gives us cleaner failure scenarios if an AZ becomes unavailable or splits from the rest of the cluster. Additionally, Datastax’s documentation has been improved to now let you know that you should not make every node a seed node.</p>\n<p>From their docs:</p>\n<p><em>Attention: In multiple data-center clusters, the seed list should include at least one node from each data center (replication group). More than a single seed node per data center is recommended for fault tolerance. Otherwise, gossip has to communicate with another data center when bootstrapping a node. Making every node a seed node is <strong class=\"ph b\">not</strong> recommended because of increased maintenance and reduced gossip performance. Gossip optimization is not critical, but it is recommended to use a small seed list (approximately three nodes per data center).</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/operations/ops_add_node_to_cluster_t.html\">http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/operations/ops_add_node_to_cluster_t.html</a></p>\n<p>It might seem fine to make every node a seed node when you only have 3 nodes in a few different AZ’s, but if your configuration management is setup to make every node a seed node, and you add more nodes you’ll soon experience similar problems as us.  Our advice, take the extra time to configure specific seed nodes in your cluster, and when you add new nodes ensure they are not seeds.</p>\n<h2>8. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Scaling any distributed database is always going to be a challenge, and Cassandra was no different.  Like most technologies, learning how things work is the first step towards making the right choices when it comes to increasing the overall footprint of your cluster.  Following basic system administration principals of making small changes over time, while monitoring the result of those changes can take you a long way toward scaling while maintaining availability and data integrity.</p>\n<p>We continue to ingest billions of unique events daily into our platform and Cassandra continues to be one of the most stable parts of our platform.  That is mainly because we’ve invested time and energy to learn from the community about operating it properly.

After asking some people around no one seemed to have a clear explanation on what was going on in Cassandra.</p>\n<p>In fact, the main misconception about tombstones is that people associate it with delete operations. While it’s true that tombstones are generated when data is deleted it is not the only case as we shall see.</p>\n<h4>Looking into sstables</h4>\n<p>Cassandra provides a tool to look at what is stored inside an sstable: sstabledump. This tool comes with the ‘casssandra-tools’ package which is not automatically installed with Cassandra. It’s quite straight-forward to install on a delian-like (e.g. unbuntu) distribution:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: bash; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\nsudo apt-get update&#13;\nsudo apt-get install cassandra-tools&#13;\n</pre>\n<p>In this blog post I used ssltabledump to understand how Cassandra stores data and when tombstones are generated.<br />\nThe syntax is pretty straightforward:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: bash; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\nsstabledump /var/lib/cassandra/data/warehouse/locations-660dbcb0e4a211e6814a9116fc548b6b/mc-1-big-Data.db&#13;\n</pre>\n<p>sstabledump just takes the sstable file and displays its content as json. Before being able to dump an sstable we need to flush the in-memory data into an sstable file using nodetool:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: bash; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\nnodetool flush warehouse locations&#13;\n</pre>\n<p>This command flushes the table ‘locations’ in the ‘warehouse’ keyspace.</p>\n<p>Now that we’re all setup, let’s have a look at some cases that generate tombstones.</p>\n<h4>Null values creates tombstones</h4>\n<p>An upsert operation can generate a tombstone as well. Why? Because Cassandra doesn’t store ‘null’ values. Null means the absence of data. Cassandra returns a ‘null’ value when there is no value for a field. Therefore when a field is set to null Cassandra needs to delete the existing data.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: sql; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\nINSERT INTO movements (&#13;\n  id,&#13;\n  address, &#13;\n  item_id, &#13;\n  quantity,&#13;\n  username&#13;\n) VALUES (&#13;\n  103,&#13;\n  'D3-DJ-21-B-02', &#13;\n  '3600029145',&#13;\n  2,&#13;\n  null&#13;\n);&#13;\n</pre>\n<p>This statements removes any existing username value for the movement identified by the id 103. And how does Cassandra remove data ? Yes, by inserting a tombstone.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.beyondthelines.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/movement-tombstone-1.png\"><img src=\"http://www.beyondthelines.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/movement-tombstone-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"149\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-858\" srcset=\"https://www.beyondthelines.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/movement-tombstone-1.png 800w, https://www.beyondthelines.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/movement-tombstone-1-300x56.png 300w, https://www.beyondthelines.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/movement-tombstone-1-768x143.png 768w\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is the corresponding ssltabledump output:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\n[&#13;\n  {&#13;\n    \"partition\" : {&#13;\n      \"key\" : [ \"103\" ],&#13;\n      \"position\" : 0&#13;\n    },&#13;\n    \"rows\" : [&#13;\n      {&#13;\n        \"type\" : \"row\",&#13;\n        \"position\" : 18,&#13;\n        \"liveness_info\" : { \"tstamp\" : \"2017-01-27T15:09:50.065224Z\" },&#13;\n        \"cells\" : [&#13;\n          { \"name\" : \"address\", \"value\" : \"D3-DJ-21-B-02\" },&#13;\n          { \"name\" : \"item_d\", \"value\" : \"3600029145\" },&#13;\n          { \"name\" : \"quantity\", \"value\" : \"2\" },&#13;\n          { \"name\" : \"username\", \"deletion_info\" : { \"local_delete_time\" : \"2017-01-27T15:09:50Z\" }&#13;\n        ]&#13;\n      }&#13;\n    ]&#13;\n  }&#13;\n]&#13;\n</pre>\n<p>Cassandra is designed for optimised performance and every operation is written to an append-only log. When a data is removed we can’t removed the existing value from the log, instead a “tombstone” value is inserted in the log. </p>\n<p>Moreover Cassandra doesn’t perform read before write (except for light-weight transactions) as it would be too expensive.</p>\n<p>Therefore when the above insert is executed Cassandra insert a tombstone value for the username field (even if there was no existing data for this key before).</p>\n<p>Now let’s consider the following statement that looks very similar to the previous one:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: sql; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\nINSERT INTO movements (&#13;\n  id,&#13;\n  address, &#13;\n  item_id, &#13;\n  quantity&#13;\n) VALUES (&#13;\n  103,&#13;\n  'D3-DJ-21-B-02', &#13;\n  '3600029145',&#13;\n  2&#13;\n);&#13;\n</pre>\n<p>But there is one difference. The first statement creates a tombstone for the username whereas the second statement doesn’t insert anything in that column.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.beyondthelines.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/movement-row-1.png\"><img src=\"http://www.beyondthelines.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/movement-row-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"195\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-857\" srcset=\"https://www.beyondthelines.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/movement-row-1.png 700w, https://www.beyondthelines.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/movement-row-1-300x84.png 300w\" /></a></p>\n<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\n[&#13;\n  {&#13;\n    \"partition\" : {&#13;\n      \"key\" : [ \"103\" ],&#13;\n      \"position\" : 0&#13;\n    },&#13;\n    \"rows\" : [&#13;\n      {&#13;\n        \"type\" : \"row\",&#13;\n        \"position\" : 18,&#13;\n        \"liveness_info\" : { \"tstamp\" : \"2017-01-27T15:09:50.065224Z\" },&#13;\n        \"cells\" : [&#13;\n          { \"name\" : \"address\", \"value\" : \"D3-DJ-21-B-02\" },&#13;\n          { \"name\" : \"item_d\", \"value\" : \"3600029145\" },&#13;\n          { \"name\" : \"quantity\", \"value\" : \"2\" }&#13;\n        ]&#13;\n      }&#13;\n    ]&#13;\n  }&#13;\n]&#13;\n</pre>\n<p>If this is the first insert for this key (no previously existing data) then both statements yield to the same state, except that the second one doesn’t insert an unnecessary tombstone.</p>\n<p>If there is existing data then what ends up in the username column might be different. With statement 1 whatever data was there it is deleted with the tombstone and no longer returned.

That’s why Cassandra inserts a tombstone and then our value. This makes sure the set now contains only the ‘pickable’ value whatever was there before.</p>\n<p>That’s one more reason to just set the values you need to update and nothing more.</p>\n<h4>Be careful with materialised views</h4>\n<p>A materialised view is a table that is maintained by Cassandra. One of its main feature is that we can define a different primary key than the one in the base table. You can re-order the fields of the primary key from the base table, but you can also add one extra field into the primary key of the view.</p>\n<p>This is great as it allows to define a different partitioning or clustering but it also generates more tombstones in the view. Let’s consider an example to understand what’s happening.</p>\n<p>Imagine that we need to query the locations by status. For instance we want to retrieve all ‘damaged’ locations. We can create a materialised view to support this use case.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: sql; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\nCREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW locations_by_status AS&#13;\n  SELECT&#13;\n    status,&#13;\n    address,&#13;\n    properties&#13;\n  FROM locations&#13;\n  WHERE status IS NOT NULL&#13;\n  AND address IS NOT NULL&#13;\n  PRIMARY KEY (status, address);&#13;\n</pre>\n<p>Good, now we can use this view to find out all the locations with a given status. </p>\n<p>But let’s consider what happens in the view when we change the status of a location with an update query</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: sql; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\nUPDATE locations&#13;\nSET status = 'damaged'&#13;\nWHERE address = 'C3-BE-52-C-01';&#13;\n</pre>\n<p>As we’ve seen this query just updates one field in the base table (locations) and doesn’t generate any tombstone in this table. However in the materialised view the ‘status’ field is part of the primary key. When the status changes the partition key changes as well.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\n[&#13;\n  {&#13;\n    \"partition\" : {&#13;\n      \"key\" : [ \"normal\" ],&#13;\n      \"position\" : 0&#13;\n    },&#13;\n    \"rows\" : [&#13;\n      {&#13;\n        \"type\" : \"row\",&#13;\n        \"position\" : 18,&#13;\n        \"clustering\" : [ \"C3-BE-52-C-01\" ],&#13;\n        \"deletion_info\" : { \"marked_deleted\" : \"2017-01-20T10:34:27.707604Z\", \"local_delete_time\" : \"2017-01-20T10:46:14Z\" },&#13;\n        \"cells\" : [ ]&#13;\n      }&#13;\n    ]&#13;\n  },&#13;\n  {&#13;\n    \"partition\" : {&#13;\n      \"key\" : [ \"damaged\" ],&#13;\n      \"position\" : 31&#13;\n    },&#13;\n    \"rows\" : [&#13;\n      {&#13;\n        \"type\" : \"row\",&#13;\n        \"position\" : 49,&#13;\n        \"clustering\" : [ \"C3-BE-52-C-01\" ],&#13;\n        \"liveness_info\" : { \"tstamp\" : \"2017-01-20T10:46:14.285730Z\" },&#13;\n        \"cells\" : [&#13;\n          { \"name\" : \"properties\", \"deletion_info\" : { \"marked_deleted\" : \"2017-01-20T10:46:14.285729Z\", \"local_delete_time\" : \"2017-01-20T10:46:14Z\" } }&#13;\n        ]&#13;\n      }&#13;\n    ]&#13;\n  }&#13;\n]&#13;\n</pre>\n<p>To maintain the view in sync with the base table Cassandra needs to delete the row from the existing partition and insert a new one into the new partition. And a delete means a tombstone.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_856\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.beyondthelines.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/materialized-view-tombstones-1.png\"><img src=\"http://www.beyondthelines.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/materialized-view-tombstones-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"398\" class=\"size-full wp-image-856\" srcset=\"https://www.beyondthelines.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/materialized-view-tombstones-1.png 800w, https://www.beyondthelines.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/materialized-view-tombstones-1-300x149.png 300w, https://www.beyondthelines.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/materialized-view-tombstones-1-768x382.png 768w\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The update in the base table triggers a partition change in the materialised view which creates a tombstone to remove the row from the old partition.</figcaption></figure><p>The key thing here is to be thoughtful when designing the primary key of a materialised view (especially when the key contains more fields than the key of the base table). That being said it might be the only solution and completely worth it. </p>\n<p>Also consider the rate of the changes of the fields of the primary key. In our case we should evaluate the rate at which the status changes for a given location (the location address doesn’t change). The less often the better off we are with respect to tombstones.</p>\n<p>Finally tombstones will disappear over time, when compaction occurs. The typical delay is 10 days (which corresponds to the ‘gc_grace_seconds’ configuration parameter). You may want to adjust it if there are too many tombstones generated during this period.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>As we’ve seen tombstones can be tricky and there not only associated to delete operations. There are many other cases that may generate tombstones. </p>\n<p>Tombstones are not necessarily a bad thing that we should avoid at all cost. It’s just a way to delete data in an append-only structure. </p>\n<p>However it can affect performances so you’d better be aware when they are generated when designing your data model and queries. </p>\n<p>If you use the java driver the query fails if more than 100,000 tombstones are seen.</p>\n<p>With this knowledge you should be able to limit their generation only when necessary. In this case you should evaluate how many are going to be generated and evaluate if it’s going to be an issue or not. If so you may want to tune the ‘gc_grace_seconds’ parameter to trigger compaction more often.</p>",

realtime <br />Variety : Structured, unstructured, semi structuredVertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine. <p>In vertical-scaling the data resides on a single node and scaling is done through multi-core i.e. spreading the load between the CPU and RAM resources of that machine.</p>Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources. <br />In a database horizontal-scaling is often based on partitioning of the data <br />i.e. each node contains only part of the data. <br />With horizontal-scaling it is often easier to scale dynamically by adding more machines into the existing pool. <br />If a cluster requires more resources to improve performance and provide high availability (HA), an administrator can scale out by adding more machine to the cluster.Scalability : Hyper scale, load balancing, scale out. <br />Availability : Failure resilient, rolling updates, recovery from failures. <br />Manageability : Granular versioning, micro service Responsive: The system responds in a timely manner if at all possible.  <p>Resilient: The system stays responsive in the face of failure. This applies not only to highly-available, mission critical systems — any system that is not resilient will be unresponsive after a failure.  </p><p>Elastic: The system stays responsive under varying workload. Reactive Systems can react to changes in the input rate by increasing or decreasing the resources allocated to service these inputs. </p><p>Message Driven: Reactive Systems rely on asynchronous message-passing to establish a boundary between components that ensures loose coupling, isolation and location transparency.  <br /></p>Micro service: <p>33TB Monthly  1.1 TB daily </p>The distributed storage system Cassandra, for example, runs on top of hundreds of commodity nodes spread across different data centers. Because the commodity hardware is scaled out horizontally, Cassandra is fault tolerant and does not have a single point of failure (SPoF).Cassandra supports a per-operation tradeoff between consistency and availability through Consistency Levels. <p>The following consistency levels are available: <br />ONE : Only a single replica must respond. <br />TWO :Two replicas must respond. <br />THREE : Three replicas must respond. <br />QUORUMA : majority (n/2 + 1) of the replicas must respond. <br />ALL :All of the replicas must respond. <br />LOCAL_QUORUMA :majority of the replicas in the local datacenter (whichever datacenter the coordinator is in) must respond. <br />EACH_QUORUMA : majority of the replicas in each datacenter must respond. <br />LOCAL_ONE : Only a single replica must respond. In a multi-datacenter cluster, this also gaurantees that read requests are not sent to replicas in a remote datacenter. <br />ANY : A single replica may respond, or the coordinator may store a hint. If a hint is stored, the coordinator will later attempt to replay the hint and deliver the mutation to the replicas. This consistency level is only accepted for write operations.</p>Spark and Spark Streaming with the RDD concept at the core are inherently designed to recover from worker failures.  <br />Stateful exactly-once semantics out of the box. <p>Spark Streaming recovers both lost work and operator state (e.g. sliding windows) out of the box, without any extra code on your part.</p>sc.cassandraTable(\"keyspace name\", \"table name\")</div></div></div><div class=\"notranslate transcript add-padding-right j-transcript\"><ol class=\"j-transcripts transcripts no-bullet

configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by distributed applications. In our example, both Kafka and Solr will need zookeeper for their state and config management, so you need to first start zookeeper.</p>\n<ul><li>Download it from <code>http://apache.org/dist/zookeeper/zookeeper-3.4.6/zookeeper-3.4.6.tar.gz</code></li>\n<li>Extract it and go inside conf directory</li>\n<li>Make a copy of zoo_sample.conf as zoo.cfg</li>\n<li>Run it using <code>bin/zkServer.sh start</code></li>\n<li>Verify its started successfully by running <code>bin/zkServer.sh status</code> command.</li>\n</ul><h2>Putting data in Kafka</h2>\n<p>Here’s steps to send data to kafka.</p>\n<ul><li>Start kafka server and broker(s)</li>\n<li>Create a topic in kafka to which data will be send</li>\n<li>Define a avro schema for the tweets</li>\n<li>Create a kafka producer which will serialize tweets using avro schema and send it to kafka</li>\n</ul><p>Download kafka from here.</p>\n<p>Start server</p>\n<figure class=\"code\"><figcaption>1\nbin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties\n</figcaption></figure><p>Create a topic</p>\n<figure class=\"code\"><figcaption>1\nbin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181/kafka --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic tweet1\n</figcaption></figure><p>You can see if topic is created successfully</p>\n<figure class=\"code\"><figcaption>1\nbin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper localhost:2181/kafka\n</figcaption></figure><h3>Avro schema</h3>\n<p>Avro is a data serialization system.

Each time impulse is generated load generator fetches data from data source and passes it to worker.

The Cassandra Source connector is used to read data from a Cassandra table, writing the contents into a Kafka topic using only a configuration file. This enables data that has been saved to be easily turned into an event stream.</p><figure id=\"f902\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*Fi0Zp7l0lbj-y9QT.png\" data-width=\"720\" data-height=\"240\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"0*Fi0Zp7l0lbj-y9QT.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*Fi0Zp7l0lbj-y9QT.png\" alt=\"image\" /></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">all logos are trademark of Apache Foundation</figcaption></div></figure><p id=\"85be\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">In our example we will be capturing data representing a pack (i.e. a large box) of items being shipped. Each pack is pushed to consumers in a JSON format on a Kafka topic.</p><h3 id=\"d7da\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">The Cassandra data model and Cassandra Source connector</h3><p id=\"10c8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Modeling data in Cassandra must be done around the queries that are needed to access the data (see <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/basic-rules-of-cassandra-data-modeling\" data-href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/basic-rules-of-cassandra-data-modeling\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a> for details). Typically this means that there will be one table for each query and data (in our case about the pack) will be duplicated across numerous tables.</p><p id=\"afac\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Regardless of the other tables used for the product, the Cassandra Source connector needs a table that will allow us to query for data using a time range. The connector is designed around its ability to generate a CQL query based on configuration. It uses this query to retrieve data from the table that is available within a configurable time range. Once all of this data has been published, Kafka Connect will mark the upper end of the time range as an offset. The connector will then query the table for more data using the next time range starting with the date/time stored in the offset. We will look at how to configure this later. For now we want to focus on the constraints for the table. Since Cassandra doesn’t support joins, the table we are pulling data from must have all of the data that we want to put onto the Kafka topic. Data in other tables will not be available to Kafka Connect.</p><p id=\"361f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In it’s simplest form a table used by the Cassandra Source connector might look like this:</p><pre id=\"e45f\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS “pack_events” (<br />event_id TEXT, <br />event_ts TIMESTAMP, <br />event_data TEXT, <br />PRIMARY KEY ((event_id),event_ts));</pre><p id=\"8ca8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">The <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">event_id</code> is the partition key. This is used by Cassandra to determine which nodes in the cluster will store the data. The <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">event_ts</code> is part of the cluster key. It determines the order of the data within the partition (see <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/the-most-important-thing-to-know-in-cassandra-data-modeling-the-primary-key\" data-href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/the-most-important-thing-to-know-in-cassandra-data-modeling-the-primary-key\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this article for details</a>). It is also the column that is used by the Cassandra source connector to manage time ranges. In this example, the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">event_data</code> column stores the JSON representation of the pack.</p><p id=\"92bc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is not the only structure for a table that will work. The table that is queried by the Cassandra Source connector can use numerous columns to represent the partition key and the data. However, <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">the connector requires a single time based column</strong> (either <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">TIMESTAMP</code> or <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">TIMEUUID</code>) in order to work correctly.</p><p id=\"10c3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This would be an equally valid table for use with the Cassandra Source connector.</p><pre id=\"3608\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS “kc_events” (<br />event_id1 TEXT, <br />event_id2 TEXT, <br />event_ts TIMEUUID, <br />event_data1 TEXT, <br />event_data2 TEXT, <br />PRIMARY KEY ((event_id1, event_id2)));</pre><p id=\"6eb6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">The most efficient way to access data in this table is to query for data with the partition key. This would allow Cassandra to quickly identify the node containing the data we are interested in.</p><pre id=\"1c5f\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">SELECT * FROM pack_events WHERE event_id = “1234”;</pre><p id=\"9ca8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">However, the Cassandra Source connector has no way of knowing the ids of the data that it will need to publish to a Kafka topic. That is why it uses a time range.</p><p id=\"89b1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The reason we can’t use the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">event_ts</code> as the partition key is because Cassandra does not support these operators (&gt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, &lt;) on the partition key when querying. And without these we would not be able to query across date/time ranges (see <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/a-deep-look-to-the-cql-where-clause\" data-href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/a-deep-look-to-the-cql-where-clause\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this article for details</a>).</p><p id=\"88ff\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There’s just one more thing. If we tried to run the following query it would fail.</p><pre id=\"a243\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">SELECT * FROM pack_events <br />WHERE event_ts &gt; ‘2018–01–22T20:28:20.869Z’ <br />AND event_ts &lt;= '2018-01-22T20:28:50.869Z';</pre><p id=\"25fc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">The connector must supply the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">ALLOW FILTERING</code> option to the end of this query for it to work. This addition allows Cassandra to search all of the nodes in the cluster for the data in the specified time range (see<a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/allow-filtering-explained-2\" data-href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/allow-filtering-explained-2\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> this article for details</a>).</p><h3 id=\"3efd\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Configuring the connector: KCQL basics</h3><p id=\"0b92\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">The Landoop connectors are configured using Kafka Connect Query Language (KCQL).

The <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">bulk</code> option will query everything in the table <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">every time</em> that the Kafka Connect polling occurs. We will set this to <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">incremental</code>.</p><p id=\"7bdb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The interesting part of the configuration is the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">connect.cassandra.kcql</code> property (shown above). The KCQL statement tells the connector which table in the Cassandra cluster to use, how to use the columns on the table, and where to publish the data.</p><p id=\"0cb8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The first part of the KCQL statement tells the connector the name of the Kafka topic where the data will be published.

The <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">SELECT/FROM</code> specifies the table to poll with the queries. It also specifies the columns whose values should be retrieved. The column that keeps track of the date/time must be part of the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">SELECT</code>statement.

This is considered the primary key for the connector.</p><pre id=\"ba12\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">PK event_ts WITHUNWRAP INCREMENTALMODE=”TIMESTAMP”</pre><p id=\"3009\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">The <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">INCREMENTALMODE</code> tells the connector what the data type of the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">PK</code> column is. That is going to be either <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">TIMESTAMP</code> or <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">TIMEUUID</code>.</p><p id=\"43cc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Finally, the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">WITHUNWRAP</code> option tells the connector to publish the data to the topic as a String rather than as a JSON object.</p><p id=\"cf66\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For example, if we had the following value in the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">event_data</code> column:</p><pre id=\"69e1\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">{ “foo”:”bar” }</pre><p id=\"e638\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">We would want to publish this as seen above.</p><p id=\"462c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Leaving the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">WITHUNWRAP</code> option off will result in the following value being published to the topic.</p><pre id=\"4821\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">{ <br />“schema”: {<br />“type”: “struct”, <br />“fields”: [{ <br />“type”: “string”,<br />“optional”: true,<br />“field”: “event_data” <br />}],<br />“optional”: false, <br />“name”: “blog.pack_events” <br />}, <br />“payload”: { <br />“event_data”: “{\\”foo\\”:\\”bar\\”}” <br />} <br />}</pre><p id=\"b0d5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">If we leave <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">WITHUNWRAP</code> off, when using the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">StringConverter</code> (more on that later) we would get the following:</p><pre id=\"b7c7\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">Struct:{event_data={“foo”:”bar\"}}</pre><p id=\"8d85\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">We will need to use the combination of <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">WITHUNWRAP</code> and the<code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">StringConverter</code> to get the result we want.</p><h3 id=\"38f1\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Configuring the connector: Tuning Parameters</h3><p id=\"c7f8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">We’ll explore these in another post.

The data platform at NerdWallet needs to be flexible enough to serve data in a form each audience can understand, while allowing to slice and dice data across many dimensions.</p><figure id=\"9130\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"><div class=\"iframeContainer\"><iframe data-width=\"600\" data-height=\"500\" width=\"525\" height=\"438\" src=\"https://medium.com/media/b1848d1a087d859733bc230071a298fc?postId=6c393a0c29ae\" data-media-id=\"b1848d1a087d859733bc230071a298fc\" data-thumbnail=\"https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.slidesharecdn.com%2Fss_thumbnails%2Fdataanalyticsnerdwallet1-170906233719-thumbnail-4.jpg%3Fcb%3D1504741267&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\">[embedded content]</iframe></div></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">FinTech Data Challenges <a href=\"https://medium.com/@NerdWallet\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@NerdWallet\" data-anchor-type=\"2\" data-user-id=\"e2e4cdb6512a\" data-action-value=\"e2e4cdb6512a\" data-action=\"show-user-card\" data-action-type=\"hover\" class=\"markup--user markup--figure-user\" target=\"_blank\">NerdWallet</a></figcaption></div></figure><p id=\"e418\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Using a combination of <a href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/\" data-href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Kafka</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/\" data-href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Redshift</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/emr/\" data-href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/emr/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">EMR</a>, NerdWallet has been able to create “ETL as Scale” and manage dynamic workloads.

Zipkin tracing doesn't support this interaction with cqlsh (it's more of a thing to use with a tracing sampling rate). Improvements in this area are possible though, for example we could use zipkin tracing when the custom payload contains a zipkin traceId and spanId and fall back to normal tracing otherwise (which would work for cqlsh interaction). For the meantime an easy fix around this behaviour in cqlsh is to reduce Session.max_trace_wait down to 1 second.</p>\n</article>",

        "url": "https://academy.datastax.com/planet-cassandra/making-the-change-from-thrift-to-cql",
        "content": "<h2>CQL Under the Hood</h2><p>At this point, most users should be aware that CQL has replaced Thrift as the standard (and therefore recommended) interface for working with Cassandra. Yet it remains largely misunderstood, as its resemblance to common SQL has left both Thrift veterans and Cassandra newcomers confused about how it translates to the underlying storage layer. This fog must be lifted if you hope to create data models that scale, perform, and insure availability.</p><p>First, let’s define some terms:</p><ul><li>Thrift: a legacy RPC protocol combined with a code generation tool. Deprecated in favor of the native protocol.</li>\n<li>Native protocol: replacement for Thrift that only supports CQL.</li>\n<li>Storage rows: keys and columns as stored on disk.</li>\n<li>CQL rows: an abstraction layer on top of the storage rows.</li>\n</ul><p>It is important to understand that the CQL data representation does not always match the underlying storage structure. This can be challenging for those accustomed to Thrift-based operations, as those were performed directly against the storage layer. But CQL introduces an abstraction on top of the storage rows, and only maps directly in the simplest of schemas.</p><p>If you want to be successful at modeling and querying data in Cassandra, keep in mind that while CQL improves the learning curve, it is not SQL. You must understand what’s happening under the covers, or you will end up with data models that are poorly suited to Cassandra.</p><p>So let’s pull back the curtain and look at what our CQL statements translate to at the storage layer, starting with a simple table.</p><h2> </h2><h3>Single Primary Key</h3><p>The first model we will examine is a straightforward table, which we’ll call books with a single primary key, title:</p><p>We can then insert some data, as follows:</p><p>And finally we can read our newly inserted rows:</p><p>What we’ve done so far looks a lot like ANSI SQL, and in fact these statements would have been valid when run against most modern relational systems. But we know that something very different is happening under the hood.</p><p>To see what this looks like at the storage layer, we can use the old command line interface, <em>cassandra-cli</em>, which allows us to interact directly with storage rows. This CLI is deprecated and will likely disappear in the 3.0 release, but for now we can use it to inspect the books table we created using CQL. Listing the contents of our table produces the following output:</p><p>RowKey: Without Remorse</p><p>As you can see, this is nearly a direct mapping to the CQL rows, except that we have an empty column at the beginning of each row (which is not a mistake; it is used internally by Cassandra).</p><p>Let’s point out a couple of important features of this data. First, remember that the row key is distributed randomly using a hash algorithm, so the results are returned in no particular order. By contrast, columns are stored in sorted order by name, using the natural ordering of the type. In this case, “author” comes before “year” lexicographically, so it appears first in the list. These are critical points, as they are central to effective data modeling.</p><h2> </h2><h3>Compound Keys</h3><p>Now let’s look at a slightly more complex example, one which uses a compound key. In this case, we’ll create a new table, authors, with a compound key using name, year, and title:</p><p>And this is what our data looks like after inserting two CQL rows:</p><p>This is where CQL can begin to cause confusion for those who are unfamiliar with what’s happening at the storage layer. To make sense of this, it’s important to understand the difference between partition keys and clustering columns.</p><h3> </h3><h4>Partition Keys</h4><p>When declaring a primary key, the first field in the list is always the partition key. This translates directly to the storage row key, which is randomly distributed in the cluster via the hash algorithm. In general, you must provide the partition key when issuing queries, so that Cassandra will know which nodes contain the requested data.</p><h3> </h3><h4>Clustering Columns</h4><p>The remaining fields in the primary key declaration are called clustering columns, and these determine the ordering of the data on disk. They are not, however, part of the partition key, so they do not help determine the distribution of data in the cluster. But they play a key role in determining the kinds of queries you can run against your data, as we will see in the remainder of this section.</p><p>Now that you know the difference, it’s time to see what our authors table looks like in its storage layer representation (with the timestamp and marker columns omitted for clarity):</p><p>You will note that our two CQL rows translated to a single storage row, because both of our inserts used the same partition key. But perhaps more interesting is the location of our year and title column values. They are stored as parts of the column name, rather than column values!</p><p>Those who are experienced with Thrift-based data models will recognize this structure, which is referred to as composite columns. You can also observe that the rows are sorted first by year, then by title, which is the way we specified them in our primary key declaration. It is also possible to reverse the stored sort order by adding the WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY clause, as follows:</p><p>Then, when selecting our rows, we can see that the ordering starts with the latest year and ends with the earliest:</p><p>While this may seem to be a trivial point, it can matter a great deal depending on the types of queries you intend to run on your data. We will examine these implications later in this post when we discuss queries.</p><h3> </h3><h4>Composite Partition Keys</h4><p>In the previous examples we demonstrated the use of a single partition key with multiple clustering columns. But it’s also possible to create a multi-part (or “composite”) partition key. The most common reason for doing this is to improve data distribution characteristics. A prime example of this is the use of time buckets as keys when modeling time-series data. We will cover this in detail later on.</p><p>For now, let’s see what it looks like to create a composite partition key:</p><p>The difference, in case it’s not obvious, is the addition of parentheses around the name and year columns, which specifies that these two columns should form the composite partition key. This leaves title as the only remaining clustering column.</p><p>At the storage layer, this has the effect of moving the year from a component of the column name to a component of the row key, as follows:</p><h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>You may be wondering why it matters how the data is stored internally. In fact it matters a great deal, for several important reasons:</p><ul><li>Your queries must respect the underlying storage. Cassandra doesn’t allow ad hoc queries of the sort that you can perform using SQL on a relational system. If you don’t understand how the data is stored, at best you will be constantly frustrated by the error messages you receive when you try to query your data, and at worst you will suffer poor performance.</li>\n<li>You must choose your partition key carefully, because it must be known at query time, and must also distribute well across the cluster.</li>\n<li>Because of its log-structured storage, Cassandra handles range queries very well. A range query simply means that you select a range of columns for a given key, in the order they are stored.</li>\n<li>You have to carefully order your clustering columns, because the order affects the sort order of your data on disk and therefore determines the kinds of queries you can perform.</li>\n</ul><p>Proper data modeling in Cassandra requires you to structure your data in terms of your queries. This is backward compared to the approach taken in most relational models, where normalization is typically the objective. With Cassandra you must consider your queries first.</p><p>With these principles in mind, let’s examine what happens when you run different kinds of queries, so you can better understand how to structure your data.</p><h2>Understanding Queries</h2><p>In order to make sense of the various types of queries, we will start with a common data model to be used across the following examples. For this data model, we will return to the authors table, with name as the partition key, followed by year and title as clustering columns. We’ll also sort the year in descending order. This table can be created as follows:</p><p>Also, for purposes of these examples, we will assume a replication factor of three and consistency level of QUORUM.</p><h2> </h2><h3>Query by Key</h3><p>We’ll start with a basic query by key:</p><p>For this simple select, the query makes the request to the coordinator node, which owns a replica for our key. The coordinator then retrieves the row from another replica node to satisfy the quorum. Thus, we need a total of two nodes to satisfy the query:</p><p>At the storage layer, this query first locates the partition key, then scans all the columns in order, as follows:</p><p>So even though this appears to be a simple query by key, at the storage layer it actually translates to a range query!</p><h2> </h2><h3>Range Queries</h3><p>If this basic query results in a range query, let’s see what happens when we specifically request a range, like this:</p><p>In this case we’re still selecting a single partition, so the query must only check with two nodes as in the previous example. The difference is that in this case, Cassandra simply scans the columns until it finds one that fails the query predicate:</p><p>Once it finds the year 1991, Cassandra knows there are no more records to scan. Therefore, this query is efficient because it must only read the required number of columns, plus one.</p><p>To recap, there are three key points you should take from this discussion:</p><ol><li>Sequential queries are fast, because they take advantage of Cassandra’s natural sort order at the storage layer.</li>\n<li>Queries by key and combination of key plus clustering column are sequential at the storage layer, which of course means they are optimal.</li>\n<li>Write your data the way you intend to read it. Or, put another way, model your data in terms of your queries, not the other way around. Following this rule will help you avoid the most common data modeling pitfalls that plague those who are transitioning from a relational database.</li>\n</ol><p>Now that we’ve covered the basics of how to build data models that make optimal use of the storage layer, let’s look at one of Cassandra’s newer features: collections.</p><h2>Collections</h2><p>The introduction of collections to CQL addresses some of the concerns that frequently arose regarding Cassandra’s primitive data model. They add richer capabilities that give developers more flexibility when modeling certain types of data.</p><p>Cassandra supports three collection types: sets, lists, and maps. In this section we will examine each of these and take a look at how they’re stored under the hood. But first, it’s important to understand some basic rules regarding collections:</p><ul><li>Each item in a collection must not be more than 64 KB</li>\n<li>A maximum of 64,000 items may be stored in a single collection</li>\n<li>Querying a collection always returns the entire collection</li>\n<li>Collections are best used for relatively small, bounded data sets</li>\n</ul><p>With those rules in mind, we can examine each type of collection in detail, starting with sets.</p><h3>Sets</h3><p>A set in CQL is very similar to a set in your favorite programming language. It is a unique collection of items, meaning it does not allow for duplicates. In most languages sets have no specific ordering; Cassandra, however, stores them in their natural sort order, as you might expect.</p><p>Here is an example of a table of <em>authors</em> which contains a set of <em>books</em>:</p><p>We can then insert some values as follows:</p><p>Cassandra also supports removing items from a set using the UPDATE statement:</p><p>At the storage layer, set values are stored as column names, with the values left blank. This guarantees uniqueness, as any attempt to rewrite the same item would simply result in overwriting the old column name. The storage representation of the books set would look like this:</p><p><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-12-03 at 4.33.07 PM\" height=\"40\" src=\"http://planetcassandra.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-03-at-4.33.07-PM.png\" width=\"16\" />                  <img alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-12-03 at 4.33.07 PM\" height=\"40\" src=\"http://planetcassandra.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-03-at-4.33.07-PM.png\" width=\"16\" /><br /><strong>                     Set Name</strong>       <strong>Item</strong></p><p>You can see that the name of the set is stored as the first component of the composite column name, with the item as the second component. Unfortunately Cassandra does not support a contains operation, so you must retrieve the entire set and perform this on the client. But sets can be quite useful as a container for unique items in a variety of data models.</p><h3>Lists</h3><p>At the CQL level, lists look very similar to sets. In the following table, we substitute the set of books from the previous example for a list:</p><p>Insertion is also similar to the set syntax, except that the curly braces are traded for brackets:</p><p>And since lists are ordered, CQL supports prepend and append operations, which involve simply placing the item as either the first (prepend) or second (append) operands, as follows:</p><p>To delete an item, you can refer to it by name:</p><p>Unlike the set, the list structure at the storage layer places the list item in the column value, and the column name instead contains a UUID for ordering purposes. Here’s what it looks like:</p><h3>Maps</h3><p>Lastly, maps are a highly useful structure, as they can offer similar flexibility to the old dynamic column names many grew accustomed to in the Thrift days, as long as the total number of columns is kept to a reasonable number.</p><p>For example, we can use a map to store not only the book title, but the year as well. Here is what that would look like:</p><p>To insert or update an entire map, use the following syntax:</p><p>You can also insert or update a single key using array-like syntax, as follows:</p><p>Specific values can be also be removed by using a DELETE statement:</p><p>At the storage layer, maps look very similar to lists, except the ordering ID is replaced by the map key:</p><p>As you can see, all these collection types make use of composite columns, in the same manner as clustering columns.</p><h2>Multi-Key Queries</h2><p>And now for one of the most common query errors, the IN clause, where we ask for multiple partition keys in a single query. Let’s recall the authors schema we introduced earlier:</p><p>Using this schema, let’s say we want to retrieve a number of books from a list of known authors. Obviously we could write a separate query for each author, but Cassandra also provides a familiar SQL-style syntax for specifying multiple partition keys using the <em>IN</em> clause:</p><p>The question is how will Cassandra fulfill this request? The system will hash the partition key—name in this case—and assign replicas to nodes based on the hash. Using the three authors in our query as examples, we will end up with a distribution resembling the following:</p><p>The important characteristic to note in this distribution is that the keys are dispersed throughout the cluster. If we also remember that a QUORUM read requires consulting with at least two out of three replicas, it is easy to see how this query will result in consulting many nodes. In the following diagram, our client makes a request to one of the nodes, which will act as coordinator. The coordinator must then make requests to at least two replicas for each key in the query:</p><p>The end result is that we required five out of six nodes to fulfill this query! If any one of these calls fails, the entire query will fail. It is easy to see how a query with many keys could require participation from every node in the cluster.</p><p>When using the IN clause, it’s best to keep the number of keys small. There are valid use cases for this clause, such as querying across time buckets for time-series models, but in such cases you should try to size your buckets such that you only need at most two in order to fulfill the request.</p><p>In fact, it is often advisable to issue multiple queries in parallel as opposed to utilizing the IN clause. While the IN clause may save you from multiple network requests to Cassandra, the coordinator must do more work. You can often reduce overall latency and workload with several token-aware queries, as you’ll be talking directly to the nodes that contain the data.</p><h2>Secondary Indices</h2><p>If range queries can be considered optimal for Cassandra’s storage engine, queries based on a <strong>secondary index</strong> fall at the other end of the spectrum. Secondary indices have been part of Cassandra since the 0.7 release, and they are certainly an alluring feature. In fact, for those who are accustomed to modeling data in relational databases, creating an index is often a go-to strategy to achieve better query performance. However, as with most aspects of the transition to Cassandra, this strategy translates poorly.</p><p>To start, let’s get familiar with what secondary indices are and how they work. First off, secondary indices are the only type of index that Cassandra will manage for you, so the terms “index” and “secondary index” actually refer to the same mechanism. The purpose of an index is to allow <strong>query-by-value</strong> functionality, which is not supported naturally. This should be a clue as to the potential danger involved in relying on the index functionality.</p><p>As an example, suppose we want to be able to query authors for a given publisher. Using our earlier <em>authors </em>table, remember that the <em>publisher</em> column has no special properties. It is a simple text column, meaning that by default we cannot filter based on its value. We can take a look at what happens when attempting to do so, as in the following query:</p><p>Running this query results in the following error message, indicating that we’re trying to query by the value of a non-indexed column:</p><p>The obvious remedy is to simply create an index on publisher, as follows:</p><p>Now we can filter on publisher, so our problems are solved, right? Not exactly! Let’s look closely at what Cassandra does to make this work.</p><h3>Secondary Indices Under the Hood</h3><p>At the storage layer, a secondary index is simply another column family, where the key is the value of the indexed column, and the columns contain the row keys of the indexed table. This can be a bit confusing to describe, so let’s visualize it.</p><p>Imagine our authors table contains the following CQL rows:</p><p>An index on publisher would then look like this at the storage layer:</p><p>So a query filtering on publisher will use the index to each author name, then query all the authors by key. This is similar to using the IN clause, since we must query replicas for every key with an entry in the index.</p><p>But it’s actually even worse than the IN clause, because of a very important difference between indices and standard tables. Cassandra co-locates index entries with their associated original table keys. In other words, you will end up with a key for “Random House” in author_publishers on every node that has keys for “Anne Rice” or “Charles Dickens” in authors.</p><p>To make this a bit clearer, the following diagram shows how our co-located <em>authors</em> table and <em>author_publisher </em>index might be distributed across a four-node cluster:</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://academy.datastax.com/sites/default/files/example-cluster.png\" /></p><p>The objective in using this approach is to be able to determine which nodes own indexed keys, as well as to obtain the keys themselves in a single request. But the problem is we have no idea which token ranges contain indexed keys until we ask each range. So now we end up with a query pattern like this:</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://academy.datastax.com/sites/default/files/pattern.png\" /></p><p>Obviously the use of secondary indices has an enormous impact on both performance and availability, since so many nodes must participate in fulfilling the query. For this reason it’s best to avoid using them in favor of writing your own indices or choosing another data model entirely.</p><p>If you decide to use a secondary index for a use case where performance and availability are not critical, make sure to only index on low cardinality values, as high cardinality indices do not scale well. But don’t go so low that your index is rendered useless. For example, booleans are bad, as are UUIDs, but birth year could be a reasonable column to index.</p><h2>Deleting Immutable Data</h2><p>We have established that Cassandra employs a log-structured storage engine, where all writes are immutable appends to the log. The implication is that data cannot actually be deleted at the time a DELETE statement is issued. Cassandra solves this by writing a marker, called a <strong>tombstone</strong>, with a timestamp greater than the previous value. This has the effect of overwriting the previous value with an empty one, which will then be compiled in subsequent queries for that column in the same manner as any other update. The actual value of the tombstone is set to the time of deletion, which is used to determine when the tombstone can be removed.</p><h3>Unexpected deletes</h3><p>Of course you can explicitly delete a column using the DELETE statement, but you may be surprised that a tombstone will be generated for every affected storage layer column. To make this clear, let’s remind ourselves about the structure of a single CQL row as represented at the storage layer:</p><p>To this point we have been using a simplified version of the storage row representation. In fact there is a third column used as an internal marker, which has been omitted for clarity. So then, let’s remove the “Patriot Games” entry, as follows:</p><p>Using cqlsh with tracing turned on, we then attempt to read the newly deleted record:</p><p>If you carefully examine the resulting trace, you will notice a line resembling the following:</p><p>So what happened? Our query that returned zero records actually had to read three tombstones to produce the results! The important point to remember is that tombstones cover single storage layer columns, so deleting a CQL row with many columns results in many tombstones.</p><h2> </h2><h3>The Problem with Tombstones</h3><p>You may be wondering why we’re so concerned about tombstones. The last example should provide a hint as to the reason. When a query requires reading tombstones, Cassandra must perform many additional reads to return your results.</p><p>In addition, a query for a key in an sstable that has only tombstones associated with it will still pass through the bloom filter, because the system must reconcile tombstones with other replicas. Since the bloom filter is designed to prevent unnecessary reads for missing data, this means Cassandra will perform extra reads after data has been deleted.</p><p>Now that you understand the basics of deletes and the problems associated with them, it’s important to point out the other ways that deletes can be generated—sometimes in ways you would not expect.</p><h3>Expiring Columns</h3><p>Cassandra offers us a handy feature for purging old data through setting an expiration time, called a <strong>TTL</strong>, at the column level. There are many valid reasons to set TTL values, and they can help to avoid unbounded data accumulation over time. Setting a TTL on a column is straightforward, and can be accomplished using either an <em>INSERT</em> or <em>UPDATE</em>statement as follows (note that TTL values are in seconds):</p><p>This can be useful when dealing with ephemeral data, but you must take care when employing this strategy, because an expired column results in a tombstone as in any other form of delete.</p><h4>How NOT to use TTLs</h4><p>A common reason to expire columns is in the case of time-series data. Imagine we want to display a feed of comments associated with a news article, where the newest post appears on top. To avoid holding onto them indefinitely, we set them to expire after a few hours.</p><p>So we end up with a model that resembles the following:</p><p>It’s important to note that this model is perfectly acceptable so far. Where we can run into problems is when we naively attempt to query for the latest values. It can be tempting to assume that we can simply query everything for a given articleID, with the expectation that old columns will simply disappear. In other words, we perform a query like this:</p><p>In some ways this expectation is correct. Old values will disappear from the result set, and for a period of time this query will perform perfectly well. But gradually we will accumulate tombstones as columns reach their expiration time, and this query requires that we read all columns in the storage row. Eventually, we will reach a point where Cassandra will be reading more tombstones than real values!</p><p>The solution is simple. We must add a range filter on timestamp, which will tell Cassandra to stop scanning columns at approximately as far back in time as the tombstones will start. In this case, we don’t want to read any columns older than three hours, so our new query looks like this:</p><p>Note that you will have to calculate the timestamp in your application, as CQL does not currently support arithmetic operations.</p><p>To sum up, expiring columns can be highly useful as long as you do so wisely. Make sure your usage pattern avoids reading excessive numbers of tombstones. Often you can use range filters to accomplish this goal.</p><h3>When Null Does Not Mean Empty</h3><p>There is an even subtler (and more insidious) way to inadvertently create tombstones: by inserting <em>null</em> values. Let’s take a look at how we might cause this situation unwittingly.</p><p>We know that Cassandra stores columns sparsely, meaning that unspecified values simply aren’t written. So it would seem logical that setting a column to <em>null</em> would result in a missing column. In fact, writing a <em>null</em> is the same thing as explicitly deleting a column, and therefore a tombstone is written for that column!</p><p>There is a simple reason why this is the case. While Cassandra supports separate INSERT and UPDATE statements, all writes are fundamentally the same under the covers. And because all writes are simply append operations, there is no way for the system to know whether a previous value exists for the column. Therefore Cassandra must actually write a tombstone in order to guarantee any old values are deleted.</p><p>While it may seem as though this would be easy to avoid—by just not writing <em>null</em> values—it is fairly easy to mistakenly allow this to happen when using prepared statements. Imagine a data model that includes many sparsely populated columns. It is tempting to create a single prepared statement with all potential columns, then set the unused columns to<em>null</em>. It is also possible that callers of an insert method might pass in <em>null</em> values. If this condition is not checked, it is easy to see how tombstones could be accumulated without realizing this is happening.</p><p>So to wrap things up, remember two things:</p><ol><li>Thrift is dead. Switch to CQL as soon as possible.</li>\n<li>But make sure you understand your data models and queries. It’s not SQL.</li>\n</ol><p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rs_atl\" target=\"_blank\">Robbie Strickland</a>, Director of Software Development at The Weather Channel</strong><br />Robbie works for The Weather Channel’s digital division, as part of the team that builds backend services for weather.com and the TWC mobile apps.

        "content": "<h2>Theory of Operation</h2><p>Tablesnap is a script that uses inotify to monitor a directory for <code>IN_MOVED_TO</code>\nevents and reacts to them by spawning a new thread to upload that file to\nAmazon S3, along with a JSON-formatted list of what other files were in the\ndirectory at the time of the copy.</p><p>When running a Cassandra cluster, this behavior can be quite useful as it\nallows for automated point-in-time backups of SSTables. Theoretically,\ntablesnap should work for any application where files are written to some\ntemporary location, then moved into their final location once the data is\nwritten to disk. Tablesnap also makes the assumption that files are immutable\nonce written.</p><h2>Installation</h2><p>The simplest way to install tablesnap is from the Python Package Index, PyPI.\n<a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tablesnap\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tablesnap</a></p><pre>pip install tablesnap\n</pre><p>This distribution provides a debian/ source directory, allowing it to be built\nas a standard Debian/Ubuntu package and stored in a repository. The Debian\npackage includes an init script that can run and daemonize tablesnap for you.\nTablesnap does not daemonize itself. This is best left to tools like\ninit, supervisord, daemontools, etc.</p><p>We do not currently maintain binary packages of tablesnap. To build the debian\npackage from source, assuming you have a working pbuilder environment:</p><pre>git checkout debian\ngit-buildpackage --git-upstream-branch=master --git-debian-branch=debian --git-builder='pdebuild'\n</pre><p>The daemonized version of the Debian/Ubuntu package uses syslog for logging.\nThe messages are sent to the <code>DAEMON</code> logging facility and tagged with\n<code>tablesnap</code>. If you want to redirect the log output to a log file other than\n<code>/var/log/daemon.log</code> you can filter by this tag. E.g. if you are using\nsyslog-ng you could add</p><pre># tablesnap\nfilter f_tablesnap { filter(f_daemon) and match(\"tablesnap\" value(\"PROGRAM\")); };\ndestination d_tablesnap { file(\"/var/log/tablesnap.log\"); };\nlog { source(s_src); filter(f_tablesnap); destination(d_tablesnap); flags(final); };\n</pre><p>to <code>/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf</code>.</p><p>If you are not a Debian/Ubuntu user or do not wish to install the tablesnap\npackage, you may copy the tablesnap script anywhere you'd like and run it from\nthere. Tablesnap depends on the pyinotify and boto Python packages. These are\navailable via \"pip install pyinotify; pip install boto;\", or as packages from\nmost common Linux distributions.</p><h2>Configuration</h2><p>All configuration for tablesnap happens on the command line.

Examples of such cases are:</p>\n<ul><li>Using only a datacenter or non-physically distributed hardware</li>\n  <li>Placing all nodes in one rack</li>\n  <li>Using SAN for storage (other than within a rack and properly configured)</li>\n</ul><p>If the hardware being rely on crashes in any of the above cases, the data might be definitely lost. Thus, it is vital to have a backup even prior to fixing any design mistakes. This holds even if the RPO (Recovery Point Objective), the date of your last backup, was a week ago. Losing a week of data is better than losing years of data, in most cases.</p>\n<p>Note that a backup strategy cannot replace a well distributed system, mostly because restore is a slow and heavy process and will always generate a small gap - a period of time during which data will be lost. However, it can prevent a bigger, or total, data loss.</p>\n<p>In fact, even when Apache Cassandra is well configured, it makes sense to have some backups. Imagine an operator needs to wipe the data on a staging or testing cluster and runs the command <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">rm -rf /var/lib/cassandra/*</code> in parallel via Chef or Capsitrano, only to find out the command was accidentally run in the production cluster instead (wrong terminal, bad alias, bad script configuration, etc…). If you are responsible for this cluster, or are just the person unlucky enough to have pressed the wrong button, you will be very glad to have a backup somewhere.</p>\n<p>Apache Cassandra will gently replicate any operation on a node throughout the cluster, including user mistakes that could potentially lose data, such as <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">DROP TABLE X</code> or <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">TRUNCATE TABLE Y</code>. Luckily for people facing this, there is a safeguard as automatic snapshots are taken by default (see the snapshots section below).</p>\n<p>But if the problem comes from heavy batch of standard operations (<code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">INSERT</code> / <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UPDATE</code> / <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">DELETE</code>), it is sometimes better to go back to a known safe point and accept losing some data than trying to deal with this new situation.</p>\n<p>A backup strategy is not foolproof, rather it just reduces the odds that something goes very wrong to a very low level. Having a full set of cluster data somewhere else, on a cold storage can be very useful. Even though it costs money and effort to put a backup and restore strategy in place, it is insignificant compared to a possible total loss of data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"backup-and-restore-solutions\">Backup and Restore Solutions</h2>\n<p>Any backup strategy will be limited by technical possibilities, as there is often a lot of data to move around when making a backup of a Cassandra cluster. Budget considerations are the second biggest constraints in many cases, as is task prioritization. Building the backup strategy is about finding the best tradeoff between these constraints and the desired RPO and RTO.</p>\n<p>Other considerations are how valuable the data is, how the risk data events is evaluated, and on the maximum data loss that is acceptable. The only recommendation we would make in this regard is to plan for your worst case scenario.</p>\n<p>Depending on the cluster, distinct solutions can be extremely efficient or perform very poorly and not reach RPO and RTO goals. What matters in order to make the right call is to understand your needs and what performances each solution provides in your own environment. There are a number of articles already covering the most common backup and restore solutions, such as https://devops.com/things-know-planning-cassandra-backup/, thus we are going to focus here on presenting one of these options, that is probably less well known, but is an excellent way to backup on AWS when using EBS Volumes.</p>\n<p>Specifically, in the following sections we will review the RPO, RTO, set up and running costs, and ease of setup for the following backup methods:\nSnapshots\nIncremental backups\nTableSnap\nSome commercial solutions\nThe copy/paste method\nAWS Snapshots/EBS Attach.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-snapshots\">Using Snapshots</h2>\n<p>After flushing all in-memory writes to disk, snapshots creates hard links of each SSTable that is part of the snapshot scope. Doing a snapshot is a simple command and comes with no immediate impacts on performance, capacity storage, or money.</p>\n<p>Running a snapshot on all the nodes and for all the keyspaces solves the potential inconsistencies issues related to copying the data out of the production disk, as the snapshot can be taken relatively simultaneously on all the nodes and will take an instantaneous ‘picture’ of the data at a specific moment.</p>\n<p>As compaction merges SSTables and depending on the compaction pace, the snapshots start consuming significant space on disk. Thus, they will need to be removed as soon as they are extracted from the disk and put into a safe place. Critically for the utility of this approach, removal has to be handled manually, as Apache Cassandra does not automatically remove snapshots.</p>\n<p>Extracting the data from the machines and then copying it to the new machines leads to a relatively bad RPO and RTO as the dataset per node grows. The transfer of such a large amount of data is also likely to raise costs making this operation prohibitively expensive to be performed often enough to be useful, thus not allowing for a good RPO in most cases.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-native-incremental-backups\">Using Native Incremental Backups</h2>\n<p>Incremental backups allow the operator to take snapshots of the missing SSTables since the latest snapshot, removing the need to snapshot all the data every time. This significantly reduces the snapshot size after the first full snapshot, reducing both the cost of extraction from the local machine and cold storage.</p>\n<p>Thus native incremental backups provide a much better RPO than the full snapshot method alone, considering that data extraction time to the external storage is part of the backup.</p>\n<p>On the downside, incremental backups are made of a lot of rather small SSTables that will need to be compacted together at the recovery time, possibly inducing a slow start from new machines after an outage and creating the need to catch up with compactions. If this is pushed to an extreme and data is spread across a lot of SSTables, the read latency could make the node completely unresponsive due to the resources used for compactions and the need for reads to open a lot of SSTables on disk, thus lowering RTO.</p>\n<p>When picking this option, it is vital to still make a full snapshot from time to time in order to prevent the situation mentioned above. For more information on incremental backups, this article is a bit old, but very well detailed: http://techblog.constantcontact.com/devops/cassandra-and-backups/</p>\n<h2 id=\"open-source-tools-tablesnap\">Open-source Tools: TableSnap</h2>\n<p>Some open-source tools are based on the snapshots or incremental backups methods, described above. These tools aim to make operators’ lives easier by providing some automation to manage snapshots and extract them to the cold storage.</p>\n<p>TableSnap copies any new SSTable in the Apache Cassandra data folder as soon as it is created, thus providing a very good RPO and the ability to go back to a specific point in time. However, it comes at the price of streaming more data than if it were just sending incremental data less frequently. This is because each compaction generates an entirely new SSTables from existing SSTables. The newly generated SSTables are then streamed to the backup destination. Regardless of whether the data exists in old SSTables at the backup destination, the new SSTables will be streamed to the backup destination. If considering this option you will want to have a look at TableSnap, which lives here: https://github.com/JeremyGrosser/tablesnap. You should also consider reading: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/snap-cassandra-s3-tablesnap-vijaya-kumar-hosamani/.</p>\n<h2 id=\"commercial-solutions-datastax-enterprise-datosio\">Commercial Solutions (Datastax Enterprise, datos.io)</h2>\n<p>In the same way, there are a handful of commercial solutions that handle backups for you. The best known is the backup / restore feature included in DSE - https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise. However, this does not work with Apache Cassandra (or open source / community version) and in order to leverage this feature, the entire DSE product will need to be purchased and used. Another alternative that has been around for a while is http://datos.io/. In fact, they do their own comparison of existing backup solutions for Cassandra here: http://datos.io/2017/02/02/choose-right-backup-solution-cassandra/.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-manual-copypaste-option\">The Manual Copy/Paste Option</h2>\n<p>While this is normally an inefficient backup solution, we spent some time working with it and had some interesting results.  This section will explore the copy/paste option in detail and evaluate the utility. Specifically the scenario involving extracting all the data from the node and putting it back on a new node or cluster.</p>\n<p>Because each node is responsible for a specific range, building a new node or a new cluster for the restore process will change the token distribution, and it is something that can be hard to control when restoring data, especially when using vnodes. Copying the data from all the keyspaces on all the nodes will induce a very messy restore procedure, or a fairly slow one using the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">sstableloader</code> for example. This is not really reliable or efficient.</p>\n<p>A way to workaround this problem is to store the entire <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">data</code> folder for each Cassandra node. This way when restoring a node or a cluster, it is possible to have the information about the schema and token range distribution saved alongside the data, in the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">system</code> keyspace.</p>\n<p>With this strategy when the node bootstraps, it detects the IP change, but this is handled and the replacement nodes come back online with the latest copy of the data, including the schema description and the token ranges distribution. This kind of backup stores the data and all the metadata used by Apache Cassandra next to it, which is really convenient, but has its limitations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"limitations\">Limitations</h3>\n<p>Using this strategy the <em>cluster</em> and <em>datacenter</em> names must be identical to the original cluster. Using the exact same configuration to restore is the best approach, just changing the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">seeds</code> in <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">cassandra.yaml</code> and the ‘dynamic’ part of the configuration, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">listen_address</code>, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">rpc_address</code>, mostly IP related informations.</p>\n<p>In addition, the topology configuration must be identical to the original cluster; that is, each rack must contain the same number of nodes as the original cluster. When data is placed back on the new nodes, data copied from nodes in rack 1 must be placed on the new nodes in rack 1 and so on for each of the other racks in the cluster.</p>\n<h3 id=\"demonstration-of-the-manual-copypaste-approach\">Demonstration of the Manual Copy/Paste Approach</h3>\n<p>To explain how to do this process and show it working, here is a short and simple example using <a href=\"https://github.com/riptano/ccm\">CCM</a>.</p>\n<p>In this example we use a predefined dataset and CCM to reduce the time taken to create the example. In practice this will work the same way with bigger datasets, but will likely take more time if copying the data from an external source of course. It will just be linearly slower to backup and restore as the dataset per node grows.</p>\n<p>Here are the files we are going to use:</p>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div

Usually, having a management system such as <a href=\"https://www.chef.io/chef/\">Chef</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ansible.com/\">Ansible</a>, <a href=\"http://saltstack.com/\">Salt</a>, <a href=\"http://puppet.com\">Puppet</a> or using containers will make adding nodes very straightforward. In the worst case, Apache Cassandra will probably just not start.</p>\n<p>This process can be repeated with all the nodes of the cluster if the entire cluster goes down and a new replacement cluster is to be built.</p>\n<p>This solution is slow, expensive, hard to set up and error-prone if done manually. Yet it works and is quite robust if performed carefully (or even better, automatically).</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-copypaste-approach-on-aws-ec2-with-ebs-volumes\">The ‘Copy/Paste’ Approach on AWS EC2 with EBS Volumes</h2>\n<p>As demonstrated above, the basic ‘copy/paste’ option can be made to work. However, in an emergency situation when an entire cluster is down, the process could be difficult to manage and terribly slow for big datasets.</p>\n<p>Some of the AWS features can take this basic backup and restore option to the next level. I have no interest in advertising for Amazon services, and even personally believe that not locking oneself with a provider or vendor is a great idea. However, in case you are already using AWS and EBS volumes, this solution might be very convenient and not really commit you much more than you already have with AWS. The set of tools offered by AWS for backups on EC2 with EBS volume storage are worth a look for those of you using this environment.</p>\n<p>Instead of copying the the data folder out of the node as we saw earlier, AWS offers to snapshot the EBS volumes. The option is available through the console or API and makes asynchronous and incremental snapshots, transferred to S3 under the hood.</p>\n<p>Because the snapshots are incremental, we can make frequent backups without technical issues or any substantial extra cost.</p>\n<p>The procedure itself to make a full backup is to <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">snapshot</code> the EBS volume(s) used for Apache Cassandra data storage. To make it simple, a few clicks or lines of code will allow a full backup. It is way more convenient and performant to use the API and make a small script that request all the snapshots at once, even more so when the cluster contains a large number of nodes. Using this functionality results in a more consistent dataset and allows for the automation of backups according to a backup schedule and policy.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://thelastpickle.com/images/backup-restore-aws/create_snapshot.png\" alt=\"Create Snapshot\" /></p>\n<p>That’s it. At this point we have a backup, in a distant and redundant system. Truth is it takes ‘some time’ to make the backup, but Amazon handles it asynchronously and incrementally. We will observe impacts on performance carefully, specially for the first snapshot. Subsequent snapshot will be incremental, thus probably less impacting.</p>\n<p>While a snapshot of all the EBS volumes attached to nodes in the cluster can be taken simultaneously, be sure that only a single snapshot is run against each EBS volume at a time to prevent harming the EBS volume performances.</p>\n<p>It is a good idea to tag the cluster name, data center, Availability Zone (AZ), and IP address the disk belongs to in the snapshot metadata (name / description / …). This is to help identify the snapshot needed when a partial failure occurs, involving just part of the cluster(s).</p>\n<p>Here is the description of the snapshot feature from AWS: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-creating-snapshot.html</p>\n<h3 id=\"backup-policy-and-automated-snapshots\">Backup policy and automated snapshots</h3>\n<p>Once we have the script to take a snapshot, it is really straightforward to build a script responsible for maintaining a snapshot policy such as:</p>\n<ul><li>Take / keep a snapshot every 30 min for the latest 3 hours, and</li>\n  <li>Keep a snapshot every 6 hours for the last day, delete other snapshots, and</li>\n  <li>Keep a snapshot every day for the last month, delete other snapshots.</li>\n</ul><p>A script in combination with a scheduler to call the script should be enough to have backups in place. Most probably the script will be called at a frequency determined by the lower interval between 2 backup. Here we would call the script every 30 min or less with the example above.</p>\n<p>This script will contain the rules to use to make backups and calls to AWS API to take and delete snapshots depending on the date of the snapshot and the current date, or anything else you would like to use to trigger backups.</p>\n<p>Using AWS Lambda service to execute the backups is possible and should be efficient. The backups being asynchronous, would mean the script should run completely in a matter of a seconds and the Lambda service cost is based on the execution time, thus it could be a good fit.</p>\n<p>To run the script on a regular basis, AWS CloudWatch Events provide events based on time. It is possible to schedule the call to the script in charge of the backup policy this way.</p>\n<p>About Lambda in AWS: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html\nAbout AWS CloudWatch Events: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/WhatIsCloudWatchEvents.html</p>\n<h3 id=\"restore-procedure-aws\">Restore procedure (AWS)</h3>\n<p>The restore procedure can be manual, which can be enough to handle a small outage involving a few nodes, or if there is no real time constraints for the RTO. For big clusters and in general, using the API and a script to restore the latest (or a specific) backup will make this process more reliable and scalable than using the AWS console. Often, using the console is nice to test things once, but unsuitable for large scale operations. The AWS API is far more powerful and lends itself well to automated tasks. For the example we will be using the console. Independently of the tool used, the process will always be the same to restore a node.</p>\n<ul><li>\n    <p>Reusing existing instances…</p>\n    <p>If the instance is still accessible but the data is corrupted or unaccessible, we can reuse the same nodes. The node is already configured as required and reusing the instance is practical. In this case:</p>\n    <ol><li>Locate the snapshot to use.</li>\n    </ol><div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre>It has to be a snapshot taken from the node to be replaced. If we are replacing or re-creating an entire rack, be sure to use the snapshots for the AZ the rack is in.\n</pre></div></div>\n    <ol><li>\n        <p>Stop Cassandra on the node to restore (if the node is not already down)</p>\n        <div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre> nodetool drain &amp;&amp; sudo service cassandra stop\n</pre></div></div>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>Unmount the currently attached EBS volume at the operating system level, supposing the EBS Volume is mounted as <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">/var/lib/cassandra/data/</code>, from a bash console, run:</p>\n        <div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre> umount /var/lib/cassandra/data/\n</pre></div></div>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>Detach and terminate the old EBS volume from the AWS console or API.</p>\n        <p><img src=\"http://thelastpickle.com/images/backup-restore-aws/detach_volume.png\" alt=\"Detach Volume\" /></p>\n      </li>\n    </ol></li>\n  <li>\n    <p>…<strong>OR</strong> using new instances…:</p>\n    <ol><li>Create a new instance in the right AZ to replace all the nodes that need to be. The instances can be created without EBS attached to them, but all the other options must be exactly identical to a new node that you would add normally to the existing cluster.</li>\n    </ol></li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Then</strong> restore:</p>\n    <ol><li>\n        <p>For each node that is down, create a new volume from the most recent associated snapshot taken. It is here that the snapshot tags are critical for ensuring the correct snapshot is restored for the node..</p>\n        <p><img src=\"http://thelastpickle.com/images/backup-restore-aws/restore_volume.png\" alt=\"Restore Volume\" /><img src=\"http://thelastpickle.com/images/backup-restore-aws/pick-az-restore.png\" alt=\"Pick the right AZ and disk size\" /></p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>Attach the newly created volume to the instance; whether it was a newly created or the original instance..</p>\n        <p><img src=\"http://thelastpickle.com/images/backup-restore-aws/attach_volume.png\" alt=\"Attach the volume to the instance\" /></p>\n        <p><strong>Note:</strong> If the instance started while the EBS volume was not yet attached, be sure to remove any newly created <em>data</em>, <em>commitlog</em>, and <em>saved_caches</em> directories that would have been created on the node’s local storage. Failure to do so could potentially mess up the token ownership as commit logs would be replayed when the node start, thus updating the system data with new token ownership from the previous ‘failed’ start. This breaks consistency guarantees and could eventually lead to a data loss.</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>Mount the new volume from the instance operating system perspective, for example:</p>\n        <div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre> mount /dev/xvdq1 /var/lib/cassandra/data/\n</pre></div></div>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>Start Apache Cassandra:</p>\n        <div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre> service cassandra start &amp;&amp; tail -100f /var/log/cassandra/system.log\n</pre></div></div>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>Finally run a repair on all the nodes and for all the tables where consistency is a concern.</p>\n      </li>\n    </ol></li>\n</ul><p>The node should join the cluster, and other nodes should detect the new IP replacing the old one. Repeat this procedure for all the nodes that need to be brought back (up to 100% of the nodes). Even with big datasets, the cluster should go back to normal <em>fairly</em> quickly and the service should go back online as soon as enough servers have been restored, depending on the configuration.</p>\n<p>It is hard to be precise here as the speed will depend on the use of the API versus the use of the console and then the volume creation will depend on the data size.</p>\n<p>Yet it is optimized by AWS and is definitely way faster than a standard backup transfer. Again, given the number of manual steps and considering how fast a cluster restore should be done in a critical situation, scripting this procedure using the API instead of the console is probably better in most (all?) cases.</p>\n<h3 id=\"summing-up\">Summing up</h3>\n<p>The AWS EBS backup solution comes with some drawbacks:</p>\n<ul><li>The topology used for the restore cluster has to be identical to that of the original cluster. Same number of node, same cluster name, same data center name, same number of nodes per rack, vnodes configuration. The safest approach is not to change anything that does need to be changed.</li>\n  <li>It is somewhat expensive. Enabling snapshots feature for EBS comes at a price.</li>\n  <li>You have to code the snapshot retention policy yourself. Yet it is basic scripting in the language you prefer using AWS API; nothing new for most of AWS users.</li>\n  <li>It is an advanced operation, that bypasses some Apache Cassandra’s safe guards around consistency. An incorrect operation can lead to a data loss. It is important to test the process then probably automate it.</li>\n</ul><p>On the bright side, with this operation we make important improvements on our backup / restore objectives:</p>\n<ul><li>The AWS Snapshots feature provides an immediate snapshot and incremental transfer of the data asynchronously, and because of this it is possible to achieve a very good Recovery Point Objective. It can be <strong>seconds</strong> if needed and as long as machines can handle it.</li>\n  <li>The Recovery Time Objective for this process is quick and consistent. That is, the time required to restore an EBS volume from a snapshot  is <em>fixed</em>. As soon as the EBS volume is mounted and the instance joins the cluster, data is is available. You can expect degraded performances as data will be loading in the background. However this is probably bearable, given the cluster was recovered from complete data loss in a short amount of time. From <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-restoring-volume.html\">AWS documentation</a>:</li>\n</ul><blockquote>\n  <p>New volumes created from existing EBS snapshots load lazily in the background. This means that after a volume is created from a snapshot, there is no need to wait for all of the data to transfer from Amazon S3 to your EBS volume before your attached instance can start accessing the volume and all its data. If your instance accesses data that hasn’t yet been loaded, the volume immediately downloads the requested data from Amazon S3, and continues loading the rest of the data in the background.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul><li>AWS service comes at a cost, but:\n    <ul><li>The incremental transfer of the data during the backup phase can save a lot of money compared to a full backup.</li>\n      <li>The cost to setup the backup service is reduced if AWS Lambda, Events scheduler, Snapshots and API are configured to do all of the work.</li>\n      <li>Restore comes at a negligible cost and is very efficient</li>\n    </ul></li>\n  <li>System tables are saved alongside the data, meaning the backup store almost everything we need to restore, including  the schema, the token range owned, topology information.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"lets-compare\">Let’s compare!</h2>\n<p>We have been through the overview of some available backup and restore solutions for Apache Cassandra. Hereafter is a table that aims at being a quick evaluation of them, a visual sum up of what is said herein.</p>\n<p>To be fair,  a backup was considered completed when the data was moved off the node to another location. For example <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">snapshot</code> or <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">incremental backups</code> solutions can easily have a RPO of 1 second, but the data still remains on the volume as the original data. Hence, if the machine is unreachable, the backup is useless. This reduces the backup efficiency to a smaller scope including for example when recovering from human errors. That is why <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">snapshots</code> have a bad RPO in the table below, we are considering all the data has to be extracted to some external storage. <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">Incremental backups</code> perform a bit better as only increments (ie. new data) are extracted.</p>\n<p>We did not compare the commercial solutions. Those evolve quickly and all have a support that will answer any question better than I would. Thus I invite you to contact companies providing this service directly.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://thelastpickle.com/images/backup-restore-aws/Compare_backup_strategies.png\" alt=\"Compare Backup Strategies\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> We saw how an overall poorly performing solution such as ‘copy/paste’ can turn out to be one of the best option in a specific environment.

        "title": "Static columns in Cassandra and their benefits - Info Support Blog",
        "url": "https://blogs.infosupport.com/static-columns-in-cassandra-and-their-benefits/",
        "content": "<p>In my previous blogpost “<a href=\"http://blogs.infosupport.com/analysis-of-the-impact-of-new-use-cases-on-a-cassandra-data-model-and-operations-in-code/\" target=\"_blank\">Analysis of the impact of new use cases on a Cassandra data model and operations in code</a>” I looked at the risks of deploying Cassandra. In Cassandra we face the challenges of data modelling and designing the CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete), because in Cassandra it is best practice to denormalize the data models. With static columns (available from Cassandra 2.0.6) we are able to restrain some of these challenges for one-to-many relationships.</p><p>To explain the approach of using static columns we first need to understand how the models for one-to-many relationships look like in Cassandra. With that explanation I also show the operations on the data models. Next, I will explain what the static columns are exactly. I will also elaborate on the operations on these models and mention some technical limitation of static columns. Next we will take a deeper dive into the read operations for the one side of the one-to-many relation. To conclude I will summarize my findings.</p><p>In Cassandra it is best practice to denormalize the data models. We denormalize because the goal in Cassandra is to execute the read operations of the use case with one query or, more preferably, one disk I/O. To illustrate the use case, the data model and the operations I will use an example about teams and team members of Formula 1 racing teams.</p><p>In the example we have two entities; teams and team members. A single team can have multiple members and a given team member is member of only a single team. The first use case is that we should be able to create, read, update and delete teams. The second use case is that we should be able to create, read, update, and delete team members of a given team. Obviously we should also be able to read all members for a given team and read the team that a team member is member of.</p><p>Assume that for a team we wish to register: the name, the manager and the location. For a team member we wish to register: the name, the nationality and the position within the team. In Cassandra we would store all these fields in one table. In that table the team name will be the partition key and the member name will be the clustering key. The table is created with the following CQL statement.</p><pre>CREATE TABLE teammember_by_team (\n  teamname text,\n  manager text,\n  location text,\n  membername text,\n  nationality text,\n  position text,\n  PRIMARY KEY ((teamname), membername)\n);</pre><h2>Insert operation</h2><p>We can insert a row with the following CQL statement:</p><pre>INSERT INTO teammember_by_team (teamname, manager, location, membername, nationality, position)\nVALUES (‘Toro Rosso’, ‘Franz Tost’, ‘Faenza’, ‘Verstappen’, ‘Dutch’, ‘test driver’);</pre><p>This statement results in a new row in the table. When we wish to add another team member to the team we need to add values for the team’s fields, again.</p><h2>Update operation</h2><p>Updating a team member is relatively easy. For example with the following CQL statement:</p><pre>UPDATE teammember_by_team SET position = ‘driver’\nWHERE teamname = ‘Toro Rosso’ AND membername = ‘Verstappen’;</pre><p>But when we wish to update a team we need to execute the update for all team members. This is one of the risks and challenges of this model. This update operation may cost many queries, for example the following queries which result in the following table with data.</p><pre>UPDATE teammember_by_team SET manager = ‘Christian Horner’\nWHERE teamname = ‘Red Bull’ AND membername = ‘Ricciardo’;\nUPDATE teammember_by_team SET manager = ‘Christian Horner’\nWHERE teamname = ‘Red Bull’ AND membername = ‘Kvyat’;\nteamname   | membername | location      | manager          | nationality | position\n-----------+------------+---------------+------------------+-------------+----------\n  Red Bull |  Ricciardo | Milton Keynes | Christian Horner |  Australian |   driver\n  Red Bull |      Kvyat | Milton Keynes | Christian Horner |     Russian |   driver\nToro Rosso | Verstappen |        Faenza |       Franz Tost |       Dutch |   driver</pre><p>A static column is defined upon creation of the table in CQL using the keyword “static”. A normal column is stored within the clustering key, within the partition. This column has a value for every combination of partitioning key and clustering key (in our example team name and team member name). A static column resides one level higher, directly within the partition key (in our example team name).</p><p>All fields belonging to the one side of the one-to-many relation may be static columns. In our example this means that the team manager and team location can be static columns. Review the following CQL statement:</p><pre>CREATE TABLE teammember_by_team (\n  teamname text,\n  manager text static,\n  location text static,\n  membername text,\n  nationality text,\n  position text,\n  PRIMARY KEY ((teamname), membername)\n);</pre><p>Because the static columns are not stored within the clustering key, but are still associated to the partitioning key, we are able to insert team data without inserting team member data. When we read this table, we get back the team with all other field having “null”.</p><pre>INSERT INTO teammember_by_team (teamname, manager, location)\nVALUES (‘Red Bull’, ‘Christian Horner’, ‘&lt;unknown&gt;’);\nteamname  | membername | location | manager          | nationality | position\n----------+------------+----------+------------------+-------------+----------\n Red Bull |       null | &lt;unkown&gt; | Christian Horner |        null |     null</pre><p>Inserting team members is much easier using static columns, because team data no longer has to be duplicated.</p><pre>INSERT INTO teammember_by_team (teamname, membername, nationality, position)\nVALUES (‘Red Bull’, ‘Ricciardo’, ‘Australian’, ‘driver’);\nINSERT INTO teammember_by_team (teamname, membername, nationality, position)\nVALUES (‘Red Bull’, ‘Kvyat’, ‘Russian’, ‘driver’);</pre><p>When we read the table after the preceding statements, the result is as expected.</p><pre>teamname  | membername | location  | manager          | nationality | position\n----------+------------+-----------+------------------+-------------+----------\n Red Bull |  Ricciardo | &lt;unknown&gt; | Christian Horner |  Australian |   driver\n Red Bull |      Kvyat | &lt;unknown&gt; | Christian Horner |     Russian |   driver</pre><p>When we now wish to update a team we are able to do so with just one query.</p><pre>UPDATE teammember_by_team SET location = ‘Milton Keynes’\nWHERE teamname = ‘Red Bull’;\nteamname  | membername | location      | manager          | nationality | position\n----------+------------+---------------+------------------+-------------+----------\n Red Bull |  Ricciardo | Milton Keynes | Christian Horner |  Australian |   driver\n Red Bull |      Kvyat | Milton Keynes | Christian Horner |     Russian |   driver</pre><h2>Technical limitations</h2><p>There are however a few limitations to using static columns. A table can only contain static columns when the table has at least one clustering key. This actually makes sense because if the table has no clustering key then all fields are stored within the partition. Next to this limitation, static columns cannot be used on tables using the COMPACT STORAGE option.</p><p>When we wish to read fields from only the one side of the one-to-many relation this requires a different approach compared to reading fields on a table without static columns. Review the following query:</p><pre>SELECT teamname, manager, location\nFROM teammember_by_team\nWHERE teamname = ‘Red Bull’;</pre><p>Without static columns these fields may be inconsistent and we will get back two rows. With static columns these values are always consistent but still we get back two rows. We get back two rows because there are two team members. If we wish to get back one row per team then all we have to do is add the DISTINCT keyword:</p><pre>SELECT DISTINCT teamname, manager, location\nFROM teammember_by_team\nWHERE teamname = ‘Red Bull’;</pre><p>Cassandra understands that the distinct keyword requires a special treatment because all fields queried are static (besides the partition key). The data can be returned faster compared to not using static columns because in the latter case the values actually have to be compared.</p><p>Static columns provide benefits for one-to-many relations. These benefits constrain a couple of great risks as described in the previous blogpost. The insert operations become easier and more flexible at the one side on the one-to-many relation. The update performed on the entity side of the one-to-many relation is reduced from many queries to just one query. Also select queries at the single entity side of the one-to-many relation are improved.</p><h2>References</h2><p>[1] <a href=\"http://blogs.infosupport.com/analysis-of-the-impact-of-new-use-cases-on-a-cassandra-data-model-and-operations-in-code/\" target=\"_blank\">Analysis of the impact of new use cases on a Cassandra data model and operations in code</a></p><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/cql-in-2-0-6\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/cql-in-2-0-6</a></p><p>[3] <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-6561\" target=\"_blank\">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-6561</a></p><p>[4] <a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cql/3.1/cql/cql_reference/refStaticCol.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cql/3.1/cql/cql_reference/refStaticCol.html</a></p><p>[5] <a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cql/3.1/cql/cql_using/use-batch-static.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cql/3.1/cql/cql_using/use-batch-static.html</a></p><p>[6] <a href=\"http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/cql3/CQL.html#createTablepartitionClustering\" target=\"_blank\">http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/cql3/CQL.html#createTablepartitionClustering</a></p><p>[7] <a href=\"https://books.google.nl/books?id=n1nTBgAAQBAJ\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.nl/books?id=n1nTBgAAQBAJ</a></p>",

For these reasons, my team uses it very often for our internal applications.But as with any piece of software, Cassandra has its own quirks and habits that you need to understand in order to effectively develop with it. In this article, I’ll show you a Cassandra performance issue that we recently dealt with, and I want to cover how we spotted the problem, what kind of troubleshooting we did to better understand it, and how we eventually solved it.The problemOne of our internal applications requires storing, and later processing, several thousands streams, where each stream consists of about a dozen binary blobs arriving periodically. Since we have many streams, and each blob can be fairly big (in the range of 10KB), we decided to use Cassandra 2.1 (a very stable version at the time of writing) and this very simple table:CREATE TABLE streams ( <br />&#13;\n    stream_id int,&#13;\n    timestamp int, &#13;\n    column0 blob, &#13;\n    column1 blob,&#13;\n    column2 blob, &#13;\n    ... &#13;\n    column10 blob,&#13;\n    primary key (stream_id, timestamp));In this data model, all the blobs (10 in the above example) for a specific timestamp are stored in the same row, as separate columns. This allowed us to write a very simple application code, consisting essentially of a single write per stream during every period. Our typical read use case requires only one or two blobs at any given time. With this data model we have the flexibility of querying an arbitrary portion of the data with a single query, like this:SELECT columnX from streams where stream_id=STREAMFor a while this schema worked well for us, and the response time we experienced for the database has been very good.Recently we noticed deteriorated performance when querying streams containing particularly large blobs. Intuitively this would seem very reasonable since the data to be processed is larger, but there was something else that felt strange: despite the blobs being bigger in average, the specific ones we were retrieving in our queries were always roughly the same size as before.In other words, it seemed as if Cassandra was always processing all 10 columns (including the large ones) despite us just asking for a particular, small column, thus causing degraded response times. This hypothesis seemed hard to believe at first, because Cassandra stores every single column separately, and there’s heavy indexing that allows you to efficiently lookup specific columns.To validate our hypothesis, we wrote a separate test: in a table of N columns like ours, asking one single column should always take almost the same time regardless of the number and size of the other columns. With a little <a href=\"http://(https://github.com/gianlucaborello/cassandra-benchmarks/blob/master/cassandra_benchmark_1.py\">script</a>, we got these results:$ python ./cassandra_benchmark_1.py&#13;\nResponse time for querying a single column on a large table (column size 100 KB):&#13;\n10 columns: 185 ms&#13;\n20 columns: 400 ms&#13;\n30 columns: 613 ms&#13;\n40 columns: 668 ms&#13;\n50 columns: 800 ms&#13;\n60 columns: 1013 ms&#13;\n70 columns: 1205 ms&#13;\n80 columns: 1376 ms&#13;\n90 columns: 1604 ms&#13;\n100 columns: 1681 msWe couldn’t have been more wrong! The tests proved the exact opposite of our assumption, and in fact the response time seemed to take a time directly proportional to the number of columns in the table, even if the query asked for just one of them!&#13;\n&#13;\nDigging into CassandraIn order to understand the problem better, I used <a href=\"http://www.sysdig.org/\">sysdig</a>, an open source troubleshooting tool. If you’re not familiar with sysdig, it has the ability to capture system state and activity from a running Linux instance, and then save, filter and analyze it. Think of sysdig as strace + tcpdump + htop + iftop + lsof in one.Back to our story: I took a sysdig trace file while executing the same query of the previous test on a table with 100 columns:SELECT column7 from streams where stream_id=1This query returns a very small amount of data compared to the whole data set (around 10 MB), as sysdig can easily tell me by looking at the network activity generated by the database:$ sysdig -r trace.scap -c topprocs_net &#13;\nBytes           Process            PID&#13;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------&#13;\n9.82M            java             34323Despite this, the query takes almost 4 seconds to run, which is way more than what we want to wait in a similar scenario. Let’s take a look at the Cassandra file I/O activity while serving this single query:&#13;\n&#13;\n$ sysdig -r trace.scap -c topfiles_bytes&#13;\nBytes              Filename &#13;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &#13;\n971.04M &#13;\n/var/lib/cassandra/data/benchmarks/test-23182450d5c011e5acecb7882d261790/benchmarks-test-ka-130-Data.db &#13;\n538.80KB &#13;\n/var/lib/cassandra/data/benchmarks/test-23182450d5c011e5acecb7882d261790/benchmarks-test-ka-130-Index.db&#13;\n…Wow, Cassandra seems to have read almost 1 GB from the file storing the data for my table, pretty much the whole size of the table:$ du -hs /var/lib/cassandra/data/benchmarks/test-23182450d5c011e5acecb7882d261790/*&#13;\n...&#13;\n972M    /var/lib/cassandra/data/benchmarks/test-23182450d5c011e5acecb7882d261790/benchmarks-test-ka-130-Data.db&#13;\n…Which means that Cassandra essentially read the entire file, and this probably explains why the response time depends on the total number of columns of the table.To take a deeper look, I used the spectrogram within csysdig on the I/O events over the duration of the trace file, so that we can visualize Cassandra’s latency and frequency of I/O operations:$ csysdig -d 100 -r trace.scap -v spectro_file<a href=\"https://478h5m1yrfsa3bbe262u7muv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cassandrablog1.png\"><img alt=\"csysdig spectrogram\" src=\"https://478h5m1yrfsa3bbe262u7muv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cassandrablog1.png\" /></a>&#13;\nIf you’re not familiar with a spectrogram, here’s the high level:&#13;\nIt captures every system call (e.g. open, close, read, write, socket…) and it measures the call’s latency&#13;\n\tEvery 100 ms it organizes the calls into buckets&#13;\n\tThe spectrogram uses color to indicate how many calls are in each bucket&#13;\nBlack means no calls during the last sample&#13;\n\tShades of green mean 0 to 100 calls&#13;\n\tShades of yellow mean hundreds of calls&#13;\n\tShades of red mean thousands of calls or more&#13;\nAs a consequence, the left side of the diagram tends to show stuff that is fast, while the right side shows stuff that is slow.What this image clearly tells us is that there seems to be a constant amount of I/O activity across the whole duration of the query, so, as predicted, accessing that 1 GB is likely what is negatively impacting the response time. Also, the latency of the I/O activity seems to be concentrated across two ranges, one very short (around 100 ns – 1 us) and one much more significant (around 10 us – 1 ms).Let’s zoom into the band on the right, by selecting the area that I’m interested in exploring:&#13;\n&#13;\n<a href=\"https://478h5m1yrfsa3bbe262u7muv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cassandrablog2.png\"><img alt=\"csysdig spectrogram\" src=\"https://478h5m1yrfsa3bbe262u7muv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cassandrablog2.png\" /></a>&#13;\nThis selection will show the list of system events that match the time range and&#13;\nlatency spectrum:<a href=\"https://478h5m1yrfsa3bbe262u7muv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cassandrablog3.png\"><img alt=\"csysdig spectrogram\" src=\"https://478h5m1yrfsa3bbe262u7muv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cassandrablog3.png\" /></a>&#13;\nRead operations on the table file, tons of them. Indeed, this is essentially a full scan of the table done by reading it in chunks of 64 KB, and we can see how all those hundreds of microseconds blocked waiting for I/O add up in the final response time.Solution: Cassandra Schema RefactorWe were pretty puzzled after discovering this behavior. As I mentioned before, rows and columns in Cassandra are heavily indexed, so we knew that there was no technical limitation for the query to not be served efficiently by reading exactly those 10 MB from disk instead of the full 1 GB.Doing some research, we were able to find an issue (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-6586) describing this problem, and we understood that the behavior was meant to be that way in order to respect some semantics of the CQL query language adopted by Cassandra (omitted here for brevity, but clearly described in the issue), and the developers agreed this behavior could cause a significant performance penalty in cases like ours. While the issue is planned to be addressed in future versions of Cassandra, that left us with a bug in a production application that we had to somehow solve.We opted for a workaround: since Cassandra will always read all the columns of a CQL row regardless of which ones are actually asked in a query, we decided to refactor our schema by shrinking the size of each row, and instead of putting all the blobs in the same row, we split them across multiple ones, like this:CREATE TABLE streams (<br />&#13;\n    stream_id int,&#13;\n    column_no int,&#13;\n    timestamp int,&#13;\n    column blob,&#13;\n    primary key (stream_id, column_no, timestamp));With this new schema all our rows are much smaller while still allowing us to efficiently query a single portion of the blob, with a query such as:SELECT * from streams where stream_id=1 and column_no=7This approach turned out to be quite effective: the query above that took 4 seconds with the old data model in the extreme test case, now took just around 100 ms on the same data set! It’s also interesting to analyze the new scenario with sysdig, and check Cassandra’s I/O while serving the request:$ sysdig -r trace.scap -c topfiles_bytes&#13;\nBytes             Filename&#13;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#13;\n9.85M             /var/lib/cassandra/data/benchmarks/test-55d49260d5cb11e5acecb7882d261790/benchmarks-test-ka-16-Data.db&#13;\n…Just 10 MB, exactly the same size of the expected response. We can also use sysdig to answer the question: how did Cassandra know how to efficiently read the exact amount of data in a jungle of more than 1 GB? We can of course look at the system events done by the database process on the file:$ sysdig -r trace.scap fd.filename=benchmarks-test-ka-16-Data.db&#13;\n11285 15:13:40.896875243 1 java (34482) &lt; open fd=59(/var/lib/cassandra/data/benchmarks/test-55d49260d5cb11e5acecb7882d261790/benchmarks-test-ka-16-Data.db) name=/var/lib/cassandra/data/benchmarks/test-55d49260d5cb11e5acecb7882d261790/benchmarks-test-ka-16-Data.db flags=1(O_RDONLY) mode=0&#13;\n11295 15:13:40.896926004 1 java (34482) &gt; lseek fd=59(/var/lib/cassandra/data/benchmarks/test-55d49260d5cb11e5acecb7882d261790/benchmarks-test-ka-16-Data.db) offset=71986679 whence=0(SEEK_SET)&#13;\n11296 15:13:40.896926200 1 java (34482) &lt; lseek res=71986679Here we see Cassandra opening the table file, but notice how immediately there’s a lseek operation that essentially skips in one single operation 70 MB of data, by setting the offset to the file descriptor with SEEK_SET to 71986679. This is essentially how typical “file indexing” works when observed from the system call point of view: Cassandra heavily relies on data structures to index the various contents of the table, so that it can move fast and efficiently to arbitrary and meaningful locations. In this case, the index contained the information that the columns with “stream_id=1” and “column_no=7” started at offset 71986679.11400 15:13:40.898199496 1 java (34482) &gt; read fd=59(/var/lib/cassandra/data/benchmarks/test-55d49260d5cb11e5acecb7882d261790/benchmarks-test-ka-16-Data.db) size=65798&#13;\n11477 15:13:40.899058641 1 java (34482) &lt; read res=65798 data=................................................................................Right after jumping to the correct position of the file, we see normal sequential reads of 64 KB, in order to bring all the data into memory and process them. This loop of jumping to the right position and reading from it continues until all data (10 MB) is fully read.It’s also quite interesting to see how this second case looks like in a spectrogram:<a href=\"https://478h5m1yrfsa3bbe262u7muv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cassandrablog4.png\"><img alt=\"csysdig spectrogram\" src=\"https://478h5m1yrfsa3bbe262u7muv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cassandrablog4.png\" /></a>&#13;\nThe spectrum of the I/O operations is pretty much the same as before and latencies are concentrated around the previous values, but notice how the height of the chart is completely different. This is because each horizontal line represents 100 ms of time, and since the whole query took about 100ms, the whole activity can be rendered in a much shorter chart. In other words, the height of the chart is directly proportional to the response time of Cassandra, so short means faster.ConclusionsThis story has two important messages into it, focused on monitoring and troubleshooting:Monitoring: Monitoring all the tiers of your infrastructure is very important. In this case, simply correlating the amount of data requested from Cassandra with the amount of I/O activity actually generated by the database helped us finding the cause of the problem, which we noticed in the first place by once again monitoring the response time of the queries.&#13;\n\tTroubleshooting: with <a href=\"http://sysdig.org\">sysdig</a>, I’ve been able to dig into the specific behavior of Cassandra (e.g. confirming that the indexing was actually used by observing the lseek() activity) without even having to read its code and understand its internals, which for sure would have taken me more time. This concept is very powerful: if you already have some expectations of how a specific application is supposed to behave, observing its activity from the system call point of view can in many cases be an extremely effective way to do troubleshooting without spending a lot of time understanding less relevant details.&#13;\n</i>",

In this demo we will use DSE as they are already integrated.</p>\n<p>First we start DSE in SearchAnalyics mode to allow us to use both Spark and DSE Search -\n<a href=\"http://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/5.1/dse-admin/datastax_enterprise/operations/startStop/startDseStandalone.html?hl=starting\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/5.1/dse-admin/datastax_enterprise/operations/startStop/startDseStandalone.html?hl=starting</a></p>\n<p>The implementation uses bucketing to group all data into particular time buckets for replay. The time bucket used in this example is 1 minute but any time bucket can be used. Also depending how many days, months, years of events that need to be kept, it may be beneficial to spread the events over different tiers of tables.</p>\n<p>To create the schema, run the following</p>\n<pre>mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=\"com.datastax.demo.SchemaSetup\" -DcontactPoints=localhost\n</pre>\n<p>To create the solr core to make our table searchable, run the following</p>\n<pre>dsetool create_core datastax.eventsource generateResources=true\n</pre>\n<p>To create events, run the following (Default of 10 million events)</p>\n<pre>mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=\"com.datastax.events.Main\"  -DcontactPoints=localhost -DnoOfEvents=10000000\n</pre>\n<p>To replay a sample event set, run</p>\n<pre>mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=\"com.datastax.events.ReadEvents\"  -DcontactPoints=localhost -Dfrom=yyyyMMdd-hhmmss -Dto=yyyyMMdd-hhmmss\n</pre>\n<p>eg</p>\n<pre>mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=\"com.datastax.events.ReadEvents\"  -DcontactPoints=localhost -Dfrom=20160805-000000 -Dto=20160805-010000\n</pre>\n<p>This replays 2 scenarios</p>\n<pre>1.

        "content": "<p>Changing from Hadoop to Spark, refining mandatory calculation, adding field statistics, storing records \nin Cassandra, indexing with Solr and calculating uniqueness.</p><h2 id=\"changing-to-spark\">Changing to Spark</h2><p>Last year I did some Coursera courses on Big Data and Data Science (I recommend you <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-manipulation\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Howe’s course</a> \nfrom the University of Washington if you like to understand theoretical background behind relational databases and\ndata science, and I don’t recommend <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/specializations/big-data\" target=\"_blank\">these courses</a>\nprovided by the University of California San Diego) where I have learnt\nabout <a href=\"http://spark.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Spark</a>. Spark’s big promise is that it is quicker \nthan <a href=\"http://hadoop.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Hadoop</a>’s MapReduce and more memory effective. For me it\nwas even more important, that I really don’t use the “reduce” part of MapReduce, and Spark is fine with that.\nThe change was not hard at all, since the business logic is separated in different classes to which Hadoop was \njust a client (the only existing client actually, but I planned to add other interfaces). For the same functionality Spark\nran 4 times faster than Hadoop (1.5 hours versus 6 hours). It was a real gain, it means that I can change the codes and\nrun it again several times a day if I want to implement something new.</p><h2 id=\"refining-mandatory-calculation\">Refining mandatory calculation</h2><p>Thanks to the feedbacks from the Europeana Data Quality Comittee we improved the mandatory dimension of the \ncompleteness measure. This tell us how a record fit to the basic Europeanaa Data Model (EDM) schema requirements. Previously\nI calculated each field individually, but that was bad: some fields are alternative to each other, so a record is valid if\neither dc:title, dcterms:alternative or dc:description is present. Now the mandatory score gives what is expected, and it \nis a real discriminator of bad records.</p><p>Now the program assigns 1 if a field is existing and 0 if not for 30+ fields. The R script creates record sets summary\nof it, and on the interface I introduces the d3.js data visualization library to display those values. I also introduces \nsome filters in the UI: the user can hide those collections which doesn’t have a particular field, those in which\nevery records have it, and those in which some records have it. The user can investigate each fields.</p><p>The usage of the fields accross all the records:</p><p><img src=\"http://pkiraly.github.io/assets/field-frequency.png\" class=\"real\" title=\"Field frequency\" alt=\"Field frequency\" /></p><p>The usage of dcterms:alternative in those data providers, which uses it in some of the records, but not in all:</p><p><img src=\"http://pkiraly.github.io/assets/field-alternative-per-data-providers.png\" class=\"real\" title=\"dcterms:alternative frequency\" alt=\"dcterms:alternative frequency\" /></p><p>An <a href=\"http://144.76.218.178/europeana-qa/field.php?field=proxy_dcterms_alternative&amp;type=data-providers&amp;exclusions%5B%5D=0&amp;exclusions%5B%5D=1\" target=\"_blank\">example</a>\nabout the dcterms:alternative across data providers.</p><h2 id=\"storing-records-in-apache-cassandra\">Storing records in Apache Cassandra</h2><p>So far it was a problem, that in the record view of the UI I was nat able to extract an individual record from the \nhuge JSON files I stored the data. After sime investigation I choosed \n<a href=\"http://cassandra.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Cassandra</a>, which has an interface for \nboth Java and PHP. I imported every records to it, but now I still use thhe JSON files stored in HDFS (Hadoop Distributed \nFile System) in the Spark analysis. It is on my TODO list to compare the performance if using files and interating over \nevery Cassandra records – my hipothesis is that file based iteration is quicker. Now only the ID and the JSON content is\nstored in Cassandra, I am thinking about to store the measurements as well: it would be good if I would like to search for \neach record having a score between say 0.2 and 0.4.</p><h2 id=\"uniqueness-calculation\">Uniqueness calculation</h2><p>I have started investigating the uniqueness or entropy of some selected fields (dc:title, dcterms:alternative \nand dc:description). The basic idea is that if the terms in these fields are frequent accross the records, then \nit is less unique, so less important. If a term is frequent in the same field it is more important than terms \nappear only once. This is called information entropy or in the search engive world TF-IDF formula (term frequency, \ninverse document frequency) – see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf\" target=\"_blank\">tf-idf</a> Wikipedia article.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://lucene.apache.org/solr/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Solr</a> search engine’s relevancy ranking \nmostly based on this formula (however there are lots of tuning \npossibilities, such as give fields weights etc.), but Solr doesn’t provide an interface by default for \nextracting the terms TF-IDF score. There is a Term Vector Component however which provides this interface \ngiven that you apply some additional indexing rules. It is not available in the ordinary Europeana Solr \nsetup so I have created a new Solr instance with this special settings, and created a brand new index with \nlimited fieldset. (If you want to check how to setup Solr and what interface you can use, check this \n<a href=\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/The+Term+Vector+Component\" target=\"_blank\">wiki page</a>.</p><p>When the index were created (it took five days, but it is improvable) the scores of a field (in this case the dc:title “Fleming/Mair wedding, Slaithwaite, Huddersfield” – from <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2022320/3F61C612ED9C42CCB85E533B4736795E8BDC7E77.html\" target=\"_blank\">this record</a>) can be read from Solr API in the following form:</p><div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre>\"dc_title_txt\":{\n  \"fleming\":{\n    \"tf\":1,\n    \"df\":1073,\n    \"tf-idf\":9.319664492078285E-4\n  },\n  \"huddersfield\":{\n    \"tf\":1,\n    \"df\":12073,\n    \"tf-idf\":8.282945415389712E-5\n  },\n  \"mair\":{\n    \"tf\":1,\n    \"df\":178,\n    \"tf-idf\":0.0056179775280898875\n  },\n  \"slaithwaite\":{\n    \"tf\":1,\n    \"df\":477,\n    \"tf-idf\":0.0020964360587002098\n  },\n  \"wedding\":{\n    \"tf\":1,\n    \"df\":10226,\n    \"tf-idf\":9.778994719342852E-5\n  }\n}\n</pre></div></div><p>Note: I did not applied truncation and other fancy Solr analyzes on the fields, it is only the lower case transformation\napplied. The API returns the stored terms in alphabetical order. I removed some properties Solr reports but \nirrelevant from our current perspective.</p><p>I have extracted these info for the above mentiond three fields, and created two scores: a cumulative \nscore which summarizes the all terms in the field, and an average, which is the average of \nthe terms’ tf-idf score. Those records which don’t have the field get 0 for both.</p><p><img src=\"http://pkiraly.github.io/assets/uniquness.png\" class=\"real\" title=\"Uniqueness\" alt=\"Uniquenes\" /></p><p>The graphs visualize the average uniqueness of terms in the field. You can see that - as expected - there are lots of records where this value is quite low - it means that the words of the title are usually common words. There are however some titles which have unique words. If the value is higher than 1, it means that a unique word appears multiple times in this field (unique means that it appears in only one record). In this particularly record set there is no such an example, but there are others, such as “Doog, Doog, Doog, Doog” (an indian one) or “Csalo! Csalo!” (a Hungarian one). In this particular dataset the most unique title is “Iganteçtaco pronoua, eta hilen pronoua.” in which “eta” is a common term, “hilen” and “Iganteçtaco” is unique, and “pronoua” is repeated unique.</p><p>In order to make comparision of the scores and the record, a two new features were added to the record view.</p><p>The first one is the term frequency viewer. Here you can see the terms stored, the term frequency (how many times the term appears in the current field instance), the document frequency (how many document has this term in this field) and the tf-idf scores Solr calculated.</p><p><img src=\"http://pkiraly.github.io/assets/term-frequencies.png\" class=\"real\" title=\"Term frequencies\" alt=\"Term frequencies\" /></p><p>The second one is a “naked” record view: it displays the non technical fields of the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">ore:Aggregation</code> and <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">ore:Proxy</code> of the record. Those fields which are not analyzed in the current session (such as tableOfContents) are displayed in grey.</p><p><img src=\"http://pkiraly.github.io/assets/record-view.png\" class=\"real\" title=\"Record view\" alt=\"Record view\" /></p><p>You can access thhe UI in the usual web interface:</p><p><a href=\"http://144.76.218.178/europeana-qa/\" target=\"_blank\">http://144.76.218.178/europeana-qa/</a></p><p>Select one of the last six dimension to get the results.</p><h2 id=\"events-presentation-article\">Events, presentation, article</h2><p>The big news is that the Europeana <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/data-quality-committee\" target=\"_blank\">Data Quality Committee</a> as a Europeana Network and EuropeanaTech Working Group is formed in March. It is a great honor, that I was involved. We have a quite active message board, a bi-weekly teleconference and a bi-yearly face-to-face meeting.</p><p><img src=\"http://pkiraly.github.io/assets/gwdg-nachrichten.png\" class=\"real\" title=\"GWDG Nachrichten\" alt=\"GWDG Nachrichten\" /></p><p>I wrote an <a href=\"https://www.gwdg.de/documents/20182/27257/GN_3-2016_www.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">article for GWDG Nachrichten</a> about the metadata quality issues in Europeana covering the roles of the Data Quality Committee, and Mr Yahyapour, the director of GWDG wrote a recommendation in the editorial column.

If you need to have better control, DataStax is better.I also did a prototype with Google Spanner in one of the recent innovation days, it provides the best of both worlds but being a service on Google Cloud Platform(GCP) works if your services are primarily on GCP. <a href=\"https://www.trustradius.com/products/amazon-aurora/reviews\" class=\"product-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-id=\"5463c14b2969e30800e8f2c0\">Amazon Aurora</a> is a relational database with higher performance and is a good candidate if search and default relational behavior is preferred.For now, DataStax worked well for us as it provides best in class performance across different kinds of read/write/mixed workloads. It provides linear scalability which works for the best performance, lowest latency and highest throughput. If configured correctly, there is no downtime and no data loss.</p>",

        "content": "<p id=\"1d80\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">At Instagram, we have one of the world’s largest deployments of the Apache Cassandra database. We began using Cassandra in 2012 to replace Redis and support product use cases like fraud detection, Feed, and the Direct inbox. At first we ran Cassandra clusters in an AWS environment, but migrated them over to Facebook’s infrastructure when the rest of Instagram moved. We’ve had a really good experience with the reliability and availability of Cassandra, but saw room for improvement in read latency.<br /> <br />Last year Instagram’s Cassandra team started working on a project to reduce Cassandra’s read latency significantly, which we call Rocksandra. In this post, I will describe the motivation for this project, the challenges we overcame, and performance metrics in both internal and public cloud environments.</p><h3 id=\"d01d\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Motivation</h3><p id=\"c5aa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">At Instagram, we use Apache Cassandra heavily as a general key value storage service. The majority of Instagram’s Cassandra requests are online, so in order to provide a reliable and responsive user experience for hundreds of millions of Instagram users, we have very tight SLA on the metrics. <br /> <br />Instagram maintains a 5–9s reliability SLA, which means at any given time, the request failure rate should be less than 0.001%. For performance, we actively monitor the throughput and latency of different Cassandra clusters, especially the P99 read latency. <br /> <br /> Here’s a graph that shows the client-side latency of one production Cassandra cluster. The blue line is the average read latency (5ms) and the orange line is the P99 read latency (in the range of 25ms to 60ms and changing a lot based on client traffic).</p><figure id=\"73e1\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*Scn1Nm33oukOJpUd4Ukszw.png\" data-width=\"1052\" data-height=\"668\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Scn1Nm33oukOJpUd4Ukszw.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Scn1Nm33oukOJpUd4Ukszw.png\" alt=\"image\" /></div></figure><figure id=\"0b14\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*ItBORNwCXce82ZNX6qf6Vg.png\" data-width=\"1052\" data-height=\"668\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*ItBORNwCXce82ZNX6qf6Vg.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ItBORNwCXce82ZNX6qf6Vg.png\" alt=\"image\" /></div></figure><p id=\"0e33\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">After investigation, we found the JVM garbage collector (GC) contributed a lot to the latency spikes. We defined a metric called GC stall percentage to measure the percentage of time a Cassandra server was doing stop-the-world GC (Young Gen GC) and could not serve client requests. Here’s another graph that shows the GC stall percentage on our production Cassandra servers. It was 1.25% during the lowest traffic time windows, and could be as high as 2.5% during peak hours.</p><p id=\"14d6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The graph shows that a Cassandra server instance could spend 2.5% of runtime on garbage collections instead of serving client requests. The GC overhead obviously had a big impact on our P99 latency, so if we could lower the GC stall percentage, we would be able to reduce our P99 latency significantly.</p><h3 id=\"87af\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Solution</h3><p id=\"5830\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Apache Cassandra is a distributed database with it’s own LSM tree-based storage engine written in Java. We found that the components in the storage engine, like memtable, compaction, read/write path, etc., created a lot of objects in the Java heap and generated a lot of overhead to JVM. To reduce the GC impact from the storage engine, we considered different approaches and ultimately decided to develop a C++ storage engine to replace existing ones. <br /> <br />We did not want to build a new storage engine from scratch, so we decided to build the new storage engine on top of RocksDB. <br /> <br />RocksDB is an open source, high-performance embedded database for key-value data. It’s written in C++, and provides official API language bindings for C++, C, and Java. RocksDB is optimized for performance, especially on fast storage like SSD. It’s widely used in the industry as the storage engine for MySQL, mongoDB, and other popular databases.</p><h3 id=\"cb1c\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Challenges</h3><p id=\"4c10\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">We overcame three main challenges when implementing the new storage engine on RocksDB.<br /> <br />The first challenge was that Cassandra does not have a pluggable storage engine architecture yet, which means the existing storage engine is coupled together with other components in the database. To find a balance between massive refactoring and quick iterations, we defined a new storage engine API, including the most common read/write and streaming interfaces. This way we could implement the new storage engine behind the API and inject it into the related code paths inside Cassandra.<br /> <br />Secondly, Cassandra supports rich data types and table schema, while RocksDB provides purely key-value interfaces. We carefully defined the encoding/decoding algorithms to support Cassandra’s data model within RocksDB’s data structure and supported same-query semantics as original Cassandra. <br /> <br />The third challenge was about streaming. Streaming is an important component for a distributed database like Cassandra. Whenever we join or remove a node from a Cassandra cluster, Cassandra needs to stream data among different nodes to balance the load across the cluster. The existing streaming implementation was based on the details in the current storage engine. Accordingly, we had to decouple them from each other, make an abstraction layer, and re-implement the streaming using RocksDB APIs. For high streaming throughput, we now stream data into temp sst files first, and then use the RocksDB ingest file API to bulk load them into the RocksDB instance at once.</p><h3 id=\"a1f4\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Performance metrics</h3><p id=\"7a2f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">After about a year of development and testing, we have finished a first version of the implementation and successfully rolled it into several production Cassandra clusters in Instagram. In one of our production clusters, the P99 read latency dropped from 60ms to 20ms. We also observed that the GC stalls on that cluster dropped from 2.5% to 0.3%, which was a 10X reduction!<br /> <br />We also wanted to verify whether Rocksandra would perform well in a public cloud environment. We setup a Cassandra cluster in an AWS environment using three i3.8 xlarge EC2 instances, each with 32 cores CPU, 244GB memory, and raid0 with 4 nvme flash disks. <br /> <br />We used <a href=\"https://github.com/Netflix/ndbench\" data-href=\"https://github.com/Netflix/ndbench\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NDBench</a> for the benchmark, and the default table schema in the framework:</p><blockquote id=\"7425\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><div><code class=\"markup--code markup--blockquote-code\">TABLE emp (</code><br /> <code class=\"markup--code markup--blockquote-code\">emp_uname text PRIMARY KEY,<br />emp_dept text,<br />emp_first text,<br />emp_last text</code><br /> <code class=\"markup--code markup--blockquote-code\">)</code></div></blockquote><p id=\"e302\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">We pre-loaded 250M 6KB rows into the database (each server stores about 500GB data on disk). We configured 128 readers and 128 writers in NDBench.<br /> <br />We tested different workloads and measured the avg/P99/P999 read/write latencies. As you can see, Rocksandra provided much lower and consistent tail read/write latency.</p><figure id=\"f950\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*Mpvc-jd61xmcrE4aEth4NA.png\" data-width=\"1132\" data-height=\"725\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Mpvc-jd61xmcrE4aEth4NA.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Mpvc-jd61xmcrE4aEth4NA.png\" alt=\"image\" /></div></figure><figure id=\"8947\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*zZO7xeU8fsWosWbkev873g.png\" data-width=\"1131\" data-height=\"724\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*zZO7xeU8fsWosWbkev873g.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zZO7xeU8fsWosWbkev873g.png\" alt=\"image\" /></div></figure><p id=\"7f48\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">We also tested a read-only workload and observed that, at similar P99 read latency (2ms), Rocksandra could provide 10X higher read throughput (300K/s for Rocksandra vs. 30K/s for C* 3.0).</p><figure id=\"7652\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*E-2efj-mMo0dQWEvZyxn1g.png\" data-width=\"1483\" data-height=\"746\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*E-2efj-mMo0dQWEvZyxn1g.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*E-2efj-mMo0dQWEvZyxn1g.png\" alt=\"image\" /></div></figure><figure id=\"b56d\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*d5gs5SJzq6laocevBqA1Bg.png\" data-width=\"1359\" data-height=\"731\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*d5gs5SJzq6laocevBqA1Bg.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*d5gs5SJzq6laocevBqA1Bg.png\" alt=\"image\" /></div></figure><h3 id=\"d343\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\">Future work</h3><p id=\"5bac\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">We have open sourced our <a href=\"https://github.com/Instagram/cassandra/tree/rocks_3.0\" data-href=\"https://github.com/Instagram/cassandra/tree/rocks_3.0\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rocksandra code base</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/Instagram/cassandra-aws-benchmark\" data-href=\"https://github.com/Instagram/cassandra-aws-benchmark\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">benchmark framework</a>, which you can download from Github to try out in your own environment!

(By the way – it has been a very influential paper and set the foundations for several NoSQL databases).</p>\n<p>Of course it means that DynamoDB and Cassandra have a lot in common! (They have the same DNA). However both AWS DynamoDB and Apache Cassandra have evolved quite a lot since this paper was written back in 2007 and there are now some key differences to be aware of when choosing between the two.</p>\n<p>This post aims at comparing these 2 distributed databases so that you can choose the one that best matches your requirements.</p>\n<h2>The concept</h2>\n<p>First of all let’s talk about the things they have in common and it starts with their implementation concept: Both of them map partition key onto a token ring using constant hashing to determine where to store the data.</p>\n<p>The idea is that the partition key is hashed into a 128 bits value. All the possible hash-values form a ring and each node in the cluster is responsible for one (or more) range of the ring.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://beyondthelines.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tokenring.png\"><img src=\"http://beyondthelines.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tokenring.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"568\" height=\"508\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1406\" srcset=\"https://www.beyondthelines.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tokenring.png 568w, https://www.beyondthelines.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tokenring-300x268.png 300w\" /></a></p>\n<p>By hashing the partition key every node is able to know the range it belongs to and from there the node in charge of this range. Of course we also need availability so the data needs to be replicated across multiple nodes. Where to place replicas (aka replication strategy) depends on the database implementation – (more on that later).</p>\n<p>It means that both DynamoDB and Cassandra are true peer-to-peer systems, with no master nodes (and no single point-of-failures). It also means that you can send your queries to any node in the cluster (or even better have your driver sent the request to the most appropriate node).</p>\n<h2>The data structure</h2>\n<h3>Primary key</h3>\n<p>Both databases belong to the column-family. Each item is identified by a primary key composed of 2 parts:</p>\n<ul><li>The partition key (mandatory): determines the partition where the item is stored</li>\n<li>The sort or cluster key (optional): determines how the item are sorting inside a partition</li>\n</ul><p>Cassandra supports any number of fields for both the partition key and the clustering key. On the other hand DynamoDB supports only 2 fields: one for the partition key and one for the sort key. It means that if you need several attributes to compose your key you need to manually concatenate them into a single field.</p>\n<h3>Schema</h3>\n<p>Cassandra supports structured data by means of a schema definition that you define in the table creation request in CQL (Cassandra Query Language).</p>\n<p>DynamoDB is schema-less (except for the primary key). Items in the same table can have completely different attributes (except for the partition and sort key).</p>\n<h3>Indexes</h3>\n<p>Both Cassandra and DynamoDB supports secondary indexes in order to query an item using an attribute that is not part of the primary key.</p>\n<p>However secondary index are usually slower and should be used wisely (preferred for attributes with low-cardinality).</p>\n<h3>Materialised views</h3>\n<p>Again both databases support materialised views (although DynamoDB calls them “Global secondary index”).</p>\n<h3>Time-To-Live</h3>\n<p>DynamoDB supports TTL at the item level. It means that when the TTL expires the whole item is deleted.</p>\n<p>Cassandra offers finer control as it supports TTL on columns which makes it possible to expire only certain fields of an item.</p>\n<h2>Consistency</h2>\n<p>One of the advantage of the dynamo family of NoSQL databases is that you can control the level of consistency that you need. E.g. if eventual consistency is enough for your application you can read one copy from any node in the cluster – it might not be the most up-to-date version of the data but it’s the fastest way to query the database.</p>\n<p>On the other hand you can require multiple nodes to answer your query making sure that you retrieve the latest version of the data.</p>\n<p>This is basically the 2 consistency levels that DynamoDB offers. You can control it with a “strong-consistency” flag in the query. If false eventual consistency is enough and you might not retrieve the latest version of the data. It true DynamoDB makes sure that you get the most up-to-date version of the data. Of course using strong consistency is slower and cost you more as well.</p>\n<p>Cassandra offers the same sort of consistency levels but with much finer control. You can choose between ANY (any node may answer), ONE (one node among the replicas of the given key), QUORUM (the majority of the replicas), LOCAL_QUORUM (the local majority of the replicas), ALL (all replicas).</p>\n<h3>Conflicts resolution</h3>\n<p>Although there is a preferred node in charge of a partition it may happen that we end up with a conflict for a given key (e.g. the preferred node wasn’t available). In this case DynamoDB and Cassandra take a different approach.</p>\n<p>The Cassandra strategy is simple: Every node add a timestamp when it writes the data. When there is a conflict the data with the most recent timestamp wins. This is the last-write-wins (LWW) strategy.</p>\n<p>Note that each field has its own timestamp so that it’s always possible to merge the changes if they concern different fields of the same object.</p>\n<p>The Dynamo paper relies on vector-clock to detect conflicts. Every node maintains a counter (or version number) of the changes it makes to an object. When it detects a conflict it tries to merge the results (which makes sense for Amazon because in the worst case you end-up with an extra item in your cart).</p>\n<p>Although it’s not clear from the AWS documentation it seems that DynamoDB in AWS now relies on a LLW strategy as well (or a combination of vector-clocks and timestamps).</p>\n<p>In the end there is not much difference between the 2 because both of them always return a single version of an object and the application never has to resolve conflicting objects.</p>\n<p>The only control that you have is the consistency level that you set in the request.</p>\n<h2>Language</h2>\n<p>Cassandra comes with its own language: The Cassandra Query Language (or CQL). It’s pretty close to SQL with some adaptations to support Cassandra features not present in SQL (collection and user-defined types, TTL, …).</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: sql; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\nINSERT INTO cycling.cyclist_name (id, lastname, firstname)&#13;\nVALUES (6ab09bec-e68e-48d9-a5f8-97e6fb4c9b47, 'KRUIKSWIJK','Steven')&#13;\nUSING TTL 86400 AND TIMESTAMP 123456789;&#13;\n</pre>\n<p>DynamoDB relies on a specific JSON-based interface with variables replacement. The AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) makes it slightly easier but I still find using CQL much more natural.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\n{&#13;\n    \"ForumName\": {\"S\": \"Amazon DynamoDB\"},&#13;\n    \"Subject\": {\"S\": \"New discussion thread\"},&#13;\n    \"Message\": {\"S\": \"First post in this thread\"},&#13;\n    \"LastPostedBy\": {\"S\": \"fred@example.com\"},&#13;\n    \"LastPostDateTime\": {\"S\": \"201603190422\"}&#13;\n}&#13;\n</pre>\n<p>The <code>S</code> in the snippet above indicates that the attributes are of type String. It’s also possible to use variable substitution by using preceding the variable name with a <code>:</code></p>\n<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\n{&#13;\n  \"TableName\": \"Thread\",&#13;\n  \"Key\": {&#13;\n    \"ForumName\": {&#13;\n      \"S\": \"Amazon DynamoDB\"&#13;\n    },&#13;\n    \"Subject\": {&#13;\n      \"S\": \"A question about updates\"&#13;\n    }&#13;\n  },&#13;\n  \"UpdateExpression\": \"set Replies = Replies + :num\",&#13;\n  \"ExpressionAttributeValues\": { &#13;\n    \":num\": {\"N\": \"1\"}&#13;\n  },&#13;\n  \"ReturnValues\" : \"NONE\"&#13;\n}&#13;\n</pre>\n<h3>Multiple Updates</h3>\n<p>One note on updating all records stored under the same partition key. Cassandra fully support this operation by specifying only the partition key:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: sql; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\nUPDATE my_table SET some_field = \"some value\" WHERE my_partition_key = \"my_key\";&#13;\n</pre>\n<p>With DynamoDB you have to specify the entire primary key (i.e. both the hash and sort keys).</p>\n<h2>Protocol</h2>\n<p>Like all Amazon services DynamoDB offers a JSON/HTTP interface. The JSON syntax is specific to Dynamo as you need to indicate the type of the fields inside the JSON structure.</p>\n<p>To exchange data with DynamoDB you have to marshall to/from JSON which impacts performance (sometimes in a substantial way).</p>\n<p>The Cassandra client relies on a binary format to communicate with the database which makes the serialisation process more efficient (both in terms of CPU and network bandwidth). It is even more efficient than Thrift which was deprecated in favour of the CQL native protocol. Parts of its efficiency comes from the possibility to have several on-going requests at the same time.</p>\n<h3>Drivers</h3>\n<p>Both Cassandra and DynamoDB provide a set of drivers supporting most of the mainstream languages. In this section I discuss in more details the drivers available on the JVM as it is the platform I use the most.</p>\n<p>The java driver for Cassandra is pretty smart as it tries to optimise your query as best as it could (e.g. send the query to the node managing the hash of the partition key). It is also fully async and non-blocking as it can be used to send multiple requests simultaneously. The main caveat is the lack of type-safety as CQL queries are just written in plain text.</p>\n<p>There are a number of alternatives for the Scala language (<a href=\"https://github.com/outworkers/phantom\">Phantom</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/getquill/quill\">Quill</a> and more recently <a href=\"https://github.com/schemasafe/troy\">Troy</a>).</p>\n<p>The java driver for DynamoDB is obviously not as good. The implementation is based on java future which only provides blocking calls to access the value. This really is a bummer to build reactive applications. There is a so-called async version of the client but all it does is delegate the blocking to a dedicated thread pool.</p>\n<p>The good news is that Amazon is working on a new version of the java driver that will be truly async but as the time of writing is still under developer-preview (not yet stable).</p>\n<p>There are a few Scala drivers developed by the community like <a href=\"https://github.com/guardian/scanamo\">Scanamo</a> which provides nice marshalers and a Free monad based implementation. However it relies on the AWS java client under the hood. (Using the Free monad makes it easy to plug in another client though).</p>\n<p>There is also an akka-stream connector available as part of the <a href=\"https://github.com/akka/alpakka\">Alpakka</a> project. To my knowledge this is the only non-blocking client available at the time of writing.</p>\n<h3>Data replication</h3>\n<p>In my opinion this is the key differentiating factor! Cassandra is fully tuneable and let’s you configure every aspect of the data replication. You can configure the number of replicas inside each datacenter and even enable replication across datacenter (making cross-region replication seamless – in case you’re hosting your Cassandra cluster on EC2).</p>\n<p>Note that the number of replicas doesn’t change automatically. You have to manually enable more replicas when your data or traffic outgrows the available resources.</p>\n<p>With DynamoDB it’s the opposite approach! You have (almost) no control over the number of replicas involved. Everything is performed automatically by AWS. You only provision the required throughput and DynamoDB makes sure you have enough partitions to handle the load.</p>\n<p>As your data grow AWS automatically add more partition. However it doesn’t change the provisioned throughput which means less throughput per partition. If your data is uniformly distributed that’s not an issue. If not you can quickly run into problem! This can become tricky when you store time-series into DynamoDB. (There is even a whole section dedicated to this topic in the DynamoDB documentation).</p>\n<p>Basically with DynamoDB you need to make sure your data is uniformly distributed! DynamoDB documentation does a pretty good job at explaining the rules on when partitions are created and how it impacts the provision throughput per partition.</p>\n<p>AWS has recently added support for Dynamo global tables: multi-region/multi-master data replication. It uses dynamo streams to replicate the data and resolves conflicts using a LastWriteWins strategy. There is also a new table backup/restore functionality allowing to backup a whole table at once without consuming any provisioned throughput. Restore can only be made into a new table and doesn’t consume any throughput. However it doesn’t play well with the multi-region support as backups can’t be exported into another region and restoring a local replica inside a global table doesn’t generate the corresponding events on the stream (which makes it impossible to sync the other region with this table). Basically global tables are a great step-forward but it is currently difficult to import existing data into a global table. More information here: <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/global-tables/\">https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/global-tables</a></p>\n<h3>Costs</h3>\n<p>DynamoDB offers a “plug-and-play” approach. You set your expected throughput and you’re ready to go. Amazon manages everything for you. The costs are based on the provisioned throughput (0.47$/WCU and 0.09$/RCU) and storage used (0.25$/Gb). Of course you’d better check <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/\">the official pricing documentation</a> for up-to-date information.</p>\n<p>On the other hand Cassandra is free open-source software so you don’t have to pay for it. However you have to run it somewhere and you have to pay for the machine you’re going to use (most likely EC2 instances or something equivalent on GoogleCloud or Microsoft Azure). Cassandra is designed to run on cheap commodity hardware but you will need several instances (3, 5 or 7, … instances for each datacenter). You should also consider the amount of time you need to setup the cluster … </p>\n<p>Note that Datastax (the company behind Apache Cassandra) now offers <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-managed-cloud\">Datastax-Managed-Cloud</a> where they deploy and administrate a Cassandra cluster for you on AWS.</p>\n<p>AWS now offers a caching layer (most likely based on ElastiCache) on top of DynamoDB called <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DAX.concepts.html\">DAX</a>. DAX allows you to improve performances (reduced latency due to in-memory caching) and save your provisioned throughput because requests will hit the cache instead of your DynamoDB tables. DAX supports caching both for items and queries.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>As though Cassandra and DynamoDB seem very close at first sight there is a number of key differences such as</p>\n<ul><li>The replication strategy</li>\n<li>The service ownership (Database managed by you or AWS)</li>\n<li>The pricing model</li>\n</ul><p>DynamoDB is easy to get started with however you might keep an eye on the cost involved. It is also not a good choice to store more and more rarely-accessed data in Dynamo as it increases your storage costs and impacts your provisioned throughput. You’d better move this data into a dedicated table with a different throughput or even outside of Dynamo.</p>\n<p>I tried to cover the main aspects worth to consider when making a decision. However it’s quite difficult to cover everything so don’t hesitate to leave a comment if you find something missing.</p>",

All rights reserved.\nWhy is this a problem\n● In all mainline compaction strategies:\n○ Data written close together chronologically tends to compact together relatively quickly\n○ Data written chronologically far apart tends to take a long time to compact together\n■ This is why it’s an anti-pattern to append or overwrite the same partition over long\nperiods of time, your reads to that partition will end up needing to read out of a large\nnumber of SSTables\n○ Because disk capacity is not recovered until the tombstone and its underlying data are\ninvolved in the same compaction, it can take a long time to recover disk capacity\n● Some compaction strategies (DateTiered, TimeWindowed) have controls that\nallow for data to permanently stop compacting.\n○ Under these conditions there become times where it’s impossible to ever recover disk capacity\nNote, See CASSANDRA-7019 for an upcoming alternative\nAlso “Improving Tombstone Compactions” today at 4:10 in 210C\n \n  </li>\n  <li>\n      <a href=\"https://image.slidesharecdn.com/cassandrasummit2016-deleteswithouttombstonesorttls-160915170409/95/deletes-without-tombstones-or-ttls-eric-stevens-protectwise-cassandra-summit-2016-26-638.jpg?cb=1474041531\" title=\"©2016 ProtectWise, Inc.

        "title": "More Efficient Repairs in 2.1",
        "url": "https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/more-efficient-repairs",
        "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Repairs are important for every Cassandra cluster, especially when frequently deleting data. Running the <code>nodetool repair</code> command initiates the repair process on a specific node which in turn computes a Merkle tree for each range of data on that node. The <a title=\"Merkle Tree\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree\" target=\"_blank\">merkle tree</a> is a binary tree of hashes used by Cassandra for calculating the differences in datasets between nodes in a cluster. Every time a repair is carried out, the tree has to be calculated, each node that is involved in the repair has to construct its merkle tree from all the sstables it stores making the calculation very expensive. This allows for repairs to be network efficient as only targeted rows identified by the merkle tree as inconsistencies are sent across the network.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Scanning every sstable to allow for the creation of merkle trees is an expensive operation. To avoid the need for constant tree construction incremental repairs are being introduced in Cassandra 2.1. The idea is to persist already repaired data, and only calculate merkle trees for sstables that haven’t previously undergone repairs allowing the repair process to stay performant and lightweight even as datasets grow so long as repairs are run frequently.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.datastax.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/inc-vs-regular-repair-trees1.png\" alt=\"Tree construction comparison between regular and incremental repairs\" /></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Incremental repairs begin with the repair leader sending out a prepare message to its peers. Each node builds a merkle tree from the unrepaired sstables, which it can distinguish by the new <code>repairedAt</code> field in each sstable’s metadata. Once the leader receives a merkle tree from each node, it compares the trees and issues streaming requests, just as in the classic repair case. Finally, the leader issues an anticompaction command. Anticompaction is the process of segregating repaired and unrepaired ranges into separate sstables; repaired sstables are written with a new <code>repairedAt</code> field denoting the time of repair. Since sstable are not locked against compaction during the repair, they might get removed via compaction before the process completes. This costs us some efficiency, since they will be repaired again later, but does not harm correctness.</p><h2>Compaction with incremental repairs</h2><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Maintaining separate pools of repaired and unrepaired sstables causes some extra complexity for compaction to deal with. For example, in the diagram below we repair a range covering half of the initial sstable. After repair, anticompaction splits it into a set of repaired and unrepaired sstables, at which point leveled and size-tiered compaction strategies handle segregation of the data differently.</p><p>Size-Tiered compaction takes a simple approach of splitting repaired and unrepaired sstables into separate pools, each of which is compacted independently. Leveled compaction simply performs size-tiered compaction on unrepaired data, moving into the proper levels after repair. This cuts down on write amplification compared to maintaining two leveling pools.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.datastax.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/STCS-vs-Leveled-in-5351-repairs.png\" alt=\"SizeTiered Compaction vs Leveled compaction in incremental repairs\" /></p><h2>Migrating to incremental repairs</h2><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Full repairs remain the default, largely so Cassandra doesn't have to guess the repaired state of existing sstables. Guessing that everything is fully repaired is obviously problematic; guessing that nothing is repaired is less obviously so: LCS would start size-tiering everything, since that is what it does now with unrepaired data! To avoid this, compaction remains unchanged until incremental repair is first performed and compaction detects sstables with the <code>repairedAt</code> flag.</p><p>Incremental repairs can be opted into via the <code>-inc</code> option to <code>nodetool repair</code>. This is compatible with both sequential and parallel (<code>-par</code>) repair, e.g., <code>bin/nodetool -par -inc &lt;ks&gt; &lt;cf&gt;</code>. When an sstable is fully covered by a repaired range, no anticompaction will occur, it will just rewrite the repairedAt field in sstable metadata. Recovering from missing data or corrupted sstables will require a non-incremental full repair.  (For more on anticompaction, see <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/anticompaction-in-cassandra-2-1\">Marcus's post here</a>.)</p><h2>Effect of tools / commands on repair status</h2><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since the sstable’s repair status is now tracked via it’s metadata, understanding how the set of tools provided with open-source Cassandra can impact this repair status becomes important.</p><ul><li>Bulk Loading - even if repaired in a different cluster, loaded tables will be unrepaired.</li>\n<li>Scrubbing - if scrubbing results in dropping rows, new sstables will be become unrepaired, however if no bad rows are detected, the sstable will keep its original repairedAt field.</li>\n<li>Major compaction - STCS will combine each of its pools into a single sstable, one repaired and one not. Major compaction continues to have no effect under LCS.</li>\n<li>Setting Repaired Status - a new tool added in 2.1 beta 2 can be found in <code>tools/bin/sstablerepairedset</code> that allows users to mark an sstable as repaired manually allowing for an easy migration to using incremental repairs by using the <code>sstablerepairedset --is-repaired &lt;sstable&gt;</code> command. It's important to only use this tool on repaired sstables, the status of an sstable can be checked via the <code>/tools/bin/sstablemetadata</code> tool by looking at the repairedAt field.</li>\n</ul><hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/\">DataStax</a> has many ways for you to advance in your career and knowledge. \n</p><p>You can take <a href=\"https://academy.datastax.com/user/register?destination=home&amp;utm_campaign=DevBlog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=devblog&amp;utm_term=DevBlogPosts_CTA1_DSA_register\" target=\"_self\" title=\"academy.datastax.com\">free classes</a>, <a href=\"https://academy.datastax.com/certifications?utm_campaign=DevBlog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=devblog&amp;utm_term=DevBlogPosts_CTA1_DSA_certifications\" target=\"_self\" title=\"academy.datastax.com/certifications\">get certified</a>, or read <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dbas-guide-to-nosql\" target=\"_self\" title=\"dbas-guide-to-nosql\">one of our many white papers</a>.\n</p><p><a href=\"https://academy.datastax.com/user/register?destination=home&amp;utm_campaign=DevBlog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=devblog&amp;utm_term=DevBlogPosts_CTA1_DSA_register\" target=\"_self\" class=\"dxAllButtons_v3Rad2_whiteNGrayOL\" title=\"academy.datastax.com\">register for classes</a>\n</p><p><a href=\"https://academy.datastax.com/certifications?utm_campaign=DevBlog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=devblog&amp;utm_term=DevBlogPosts_CTA1_DSA_certifications\" target=\"_self\" class=\"dxAllButtons_v3Rad2_whiteNGrayOL\" title=\"academy.datastax.com/certifications\">get certified</a>\n</p><p><a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/dbas-guide-to-nosql?utm_campaign=DevBlog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=devblog&amp;utm_term=DevBlogPosts_CTA1_dbasguidetonosql\" target=\"_self\" class=\"dxAllButtons_v3Rad2_whiteNGrayOL\" title=\"dbas-guide-to-nosql\">DBA's Guide to NoSQL</a>\n</p><br class=\"clear\" /><div id=\"mto_newsletter_121316_Css\"><p>Subscribe for newsletter:</p><br /></div>",

Lets start with the simple case of having one data center with 10 nodes and 100 tokens. Where node N0 is assigned token 0, N1 is assigned token 10, and so on.</p><p>With a replication factor of 3, N3 will own data for tokens 1–30. And if we look at where that data will be replicated, you get range 1–10 shared by N1, N2, N3; 11–20 shared by N2, N3, N4; 21–30 shared by N3, N4, N5.</p><p>When nodetool repair is run against a node it initiates a repair for some range of tokens. The range being repaired depends on what options are specified. The default options, just calling “nodetool repair”, initiate a repair of every token range owned by the node. The node you issued the call to becomes the coordinator for the repair operation, and it coordinates repairing those token ranges between all of the nodes that own them. </p><p>So for our example cluster, if you call “nodetool repair” on N3 the first thing that will hapen is to split the 1–30 range into the subranges based on groups of nodes which share that data. For each of those sub ranges, the 3 nodes will all compare the data in those ranges, and fix up any differences between themselves. So for sub range 1–10, N1 and N2 compare, N1 and N3 compare, N2 and N3 compare. After the repair finishes, those 3 nodes will be completely in sync for that token range. And a similar process happens for ranges 11–20 (N2, N3, N4) and 21–30 (N3, N4, N5). So just running “nodetool repair” on N3 there will be 5 nodes repairing data with each other, and at the end tokens 1–30 will be in sync across their respective owners. Now if we next run a “nodetool repair” on N4, we will repair the range 11–40 in a similar fashion. </p><p>But wait, we just repaired range 11–30, if we repair that again we will be wasting resources. This is where the “-pr” option comes in to help. When you use “nodetool repair -pr” each node picks a subset of its token range to schedule for repair, such that if “-pr” is run on EVERY node in the cluster, every token range will only be repaired once. What that means is, when ever you use -pr, you need to be repairing the entire ring (every node in every data center). If you use “-pr” on just one node, or just the nodes in one data center, you will only repair a subset of the data on those nodes. This is very important, so I’m going to say it again, if you are using “nodetool repair -pr” you must run it on <strong>EVERY</strong> node in <strong>EVERY</strong> data center, no skipping allowed. </p><p>Back to the example ring. Since we don’t want to repair a given piece of data multiple times, we are going to use the “-pr” option. When you issue “nodetool repair -pr” against node N3 only the range 21–30 will be repair. Similarly “nodetool repair -pr” on N4 will repair 31–40. As you can see we no longer have any overlapping data being repaired, but this also means, if you only ran “nodetool repair -pr” on N3, tokens 1–20 would not have been repaired. This is very important to know if you are running repair to fix a problem, and not as part of general maintenance. When running repair to fix a problem, like a node being down for longer than the hint windows, you need to repair the entire token range of that node. So you can’t just run “nodetool repair -pr” on it. You need to initiate a full “nodetool repair” on it, or do a full cluster repair with “nodetool repair -pr”. </p><p>If you have multiple data centers, by default when running repair all nodes in all data centers will sync with each other on the range being repaired. So for an RF of {DC1:3, DC2:3} for a given token range there will be 6 nodes all comparing data with each other and streaming any differences back and forth. If you have 4 data centers {DC1:3, DC2:3, DC3:3, DC4:3} you will have 12 nodes all comparing with each other and streaming data to each other at the same time for each token range. This makes using “-pr” even more important, as if you don’t use it you repair a given token range 3+3+3+3+=12 times for the 4 DC case if you ran without using “-pr” on every node in the cluster.</p><p>A new feature available in Cassandra 2.1 is <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/more-efficient-repairs\">incremental repair</a>. You can see the linked blog post for an in depth description of it, but in brief, incremental repair only performs the synchronization steps described above on data that has not been repaired previously. This helps to greatly reduce the amount of time it takes to repair new data.</p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/\">DataStax</a> has many ways for you to advance in your career and knowledge. \n</p><p>You can take <a href=\"https://academy.datastax.com/user/register?destination=home&amp;utm_campaign=DevBlog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=devblog&amp;utm_term=DevBlogPosts_CTA1_DSA_register\" target=\"_self\" title=\"academy.datastax.com\">free classes</a>, <a href=\"https://academy.datastax.com/certifications?utm_campaign=DevBlog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=devblog&amp;utm_term=DevBlogPosts_CTA1_DSA_certifications\" target=\"_self\" title=\"academy.datastax.com/certifications\">get certified</a>, or read <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/dbas-guide-to-nosql\" target=\"_self\" title=\"dbas-guide-to-nosql\">one of our many white papers</a>.\n</p><p><a href=\"https://academy.datastax.com/user/register?destination=home&amp;utm_campaign=DevBlog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=devblog&amp;utm_term=DevBlogPosts_CTA1_DSA_register\" target=\"_self\" class=\"dxAllButtons_v3Rad2_whiteNGrayOL\" title=\"academy.datastax.com\">register for classes</a>\n</p><p><a href=\"https://academy.datastax.com/certifications?utm_campaign=DevBlog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=devblog&amp;utm_term=DevBlogPosts_CTA1_DSA_certifications\" target=\"_self\" class=\"dxAllButtons_v3Rad2_whiteNGrayOL\" title=\"academy.datastax.com/certifications\">get certified</a>\n</p><p><a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/dbas-guide-to-nosql?utm_campaign=DevBlog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=devblog&amp;utm_term=DevBlogPosts_CTA1_dbasguidetonosql\" target=\"_self\" class=\"dxAllButtons_v3Rad2_whiteNGrayOL\" title=\"dbas-guide-to-nosql\">DBA's Guide to NoSQL</a>\n</p><br class=\"clear\" /><div id=\"mto_newsletter_121316_Css\"><p>Subscribe for newsletter:</p><br /></div>",

In particular, the geo-redundancy and dynamic scale of the solution are key advantages and we look forward to reaping more benefits in the future.”</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">- Christoph Leinemann, Senior Director, Data Engineering, <a href=\"https://jet.com/\">Jet.com</a></p>&#13;\n</div></blockquote><p>With Azure Cosmos DB’s native support for Cassandra APIs you will get the following benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Fully managed, serverless Cassandra as-a-service</strong>. As a <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-cosmos-db-microsofts-globally-distributed-multi-model-database-service/\">true PaaS service</a>, Azure Cosmos DB ensures that you do not have to worry about managing and monitoring myriad of settings across OS, JVM and YAML files and deal with complex interdependencies. Azure Cosmos DB provides first-class monitoring of throughput, latency, consistency, storage and availability and configurable alerts to take action on changes across them.</li> <li><strong>Turnkey global distribution</strong>. Azure Cosmos DB was designed as a <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/a-technical-overview-of-azure-cosmos-db/\">globally distributed service from the ground up</a> to ensure that your data is made available wherever your users are. The service transparently and automatically replicates the data across any number of Azure regions associated with your Cassandra tables. You can add or remove regions for your Cassandra tables with a few clicks in Azure portal or programmatically, at any time. </li> <li><strong>Elastic and transparent scaling of storage</strong>. Azure Cosmos DB provides <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/partition-data\">automatic storage management</a> without the need for any manual intervention and grows the capacity as your application storage needs increase. You don’t need to worry about the complexities of capacity planning or having to deal with adding cluster nodes and tuning configs anymore.</li> <li><strong>Elastic scaling of throughput all around the world</strong>. With Azure Cosmos DB you don’t need to worry about tuning config settings for CPU, memory, disk IO, and compaction. Azure Cosmos DB allows you to <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/request-units\">scale throughput</a> for your Cassandra tables all around the world and guarantees the configured throughput regardless of the volume of data being stored.</li> <li><strong>Guaranteed low latency reads and writes</strong>. As the first and only schema-agnostic database, Azure Cosmos DB automatically indexes all your data so you can perform blazing fast queries. The service offers guaranteed &lt;10 ms latencies at the 99th percentile for near real-time query results.</li> <li><strong>Multiple well-defined consistency models with clear tradeoffs</strong>. Writing correct distributed application logic against an eventually consistent database is often difficult. Azure Cosmos DB helps you by providing five well-defined, intuitive and practical consistency levels, each with a clear trade-off between desired consistency and performance, guaranteed correctness and backed by SLAs. You can now choose from <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels\">strong, bounded staleness, session, consistent prefix and eventual consistency models</a> and can configure them any time and change on a per request basis.</li> <li><strong>Secure and compliant and enterprise-ready, by default</strong>. Azure Cosmos DB is secure, compliant and enterprise-ready service for mission-critical apps. Azure Cosmos DB has met the stringent compliance standards including <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/compliance/iso-iec-27001\">ISO 27001</a>, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/compliance/iso-iec-27018\">ISO 27018</a>, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/compliance/eu-model-clauses\">EUMC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/compliance/pci\">PCI DSS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/compliance/soc\">SOC 1,2,3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/compliance/hipaa\">HIPAA/HITECH</a> and <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/compliance/complianceofferings\">other compliance certifications</a>. Azure Cosmos DB also provides <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/database-encryption-at-rest\">encryption at rest</a> and in motion, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/firewall-support\">IP firewall</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/logging\">audit log for your database activities</a> to ensure demanding security standards of enterprises.</li> <li><strong>Backed by industry leading, comprehensive SLAs</strong>. Azure Cosmos DB provides industry-leading, <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/sla/cosmos-db/v1_1/\">comprehensive SLAs</a> for 99.99% high availability for single region and 99,999% read availability at global scale, consistency, throughput and low latency reads and writes at the 99th percentile. Users do not need to worry about operational overheads and tuning many dozens of configuration options to get good performance. Azure Cosmos DB <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-documentdb-service-level-agreements/\">takes away the worry of managing all these issues</a> and lets you focus on your application logic instead.</li> </ul><p>Azure Cosmos DB provides <a href=\"https://aka.ms/cassandraintro\">wire protocol level compatibility with the Cassandra API</a>. This ensures you can continue using your existing application and OSS tools with no code changes and gives you the flexibility to run your Cassandra apps fully managed with no vendor lock-in. While Azure Cosmos DB exposes APIs for the popular open source databases, it does not rely on the implementations of those  databases for realizing the semantics of the corresponding APIs. Our unique approach of providing wire-compatible APIs for the popular open sourcedatabases ensures that you can continue to use Azure Cosmos DB in a cloud-agnostic manner while still leveraging a robust database platform natively designed for the cloud.</p><p>Finally, Azure Cosmos DB has been <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/how-azure-documentdb-planet-scale-nosql-helps-run-microsoft-s-own-businesses/\">used extensively within Microsoft</a> over the years and by some of the largest enterprise customers with their mission critical workloads at an unprecedented global scale. You will now enjoy the same battle-tested, fully managed, globally distributed database service that provides the <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/documentdb-total-cost-of-non-ownership-paper-available/\">lowest TCO</a> while still using your familiar Cassandra API.</p><h2>Get started today!</h2><p>With Azure Cosmos DB, our mission is to enable the world’s developers to build amazingly powerful, cosmos-scale apps, more easily and today we are excited to welcome the Cassandra developer community!</p><p>Please <a href=\"https://aka.ms/cosmosdb-createcassandra\">sign up</a> to try the <a href=\"https://aka.ms/cassandraintro\">Apache Cassandra API</a> and the new capabilities Azure Cosmos DB can bring to your Cassandra application.

The primary Machine Learning API for Spark is now the <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html\">DataFrame</a>-based API in the spark.ml package.</p><p>This architecture diagram shows the current Spark architecture. The components of particular interest are Cassandra (the data source), MLlib, DataFrames, ML Pipelines and Scala:</p><p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://dhenschen.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/spark-2015-vision.jpg\" alt=\"Apache Spark Architecture Diagram Instaclustr\" width=\"793\" height=\"559\" /></p><p><a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/third-contact-monolith-part-c-pod/\">Last blog</a> we explored Decision Tree Machine Learning based on RDDs, using a sample of the Instametrics monitoring data, to try and predict long JVM Garbage Collections. Now we’ll update the code to DataFrames and use all the available real monitoring data (a snapshot from the Instaclustr pre-production clusters).</p><p>What are <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html#datasets-and-dataframes\">DataFrames</a>?

Because Instaclustr provides a <a href=\"https://support.instaclustr.com/hc/en-us/articles/213097877-Getting-Started-with-Instaclustr-Spark-Cassandra\">fully managed cluster option which includes Cassandra, Spark and Zeppelin</a> (a Spark Scala web-based notebook) it was easier to quickly deploy, run and debug Scala code than Java. You just type Scala code into Zeppelin in a browser, run it and look at the output (and repeat). There’s no need to set up a separate client instance in AWS. Trying to learn both Scala and Spark at the same time was “fun”. Scala is syntactically similar to Java (just throw away the semi-colons as Scala is line-oriented, and you don’t need variable type declarations as types are inferred, but statically typed), so the example should still make sense even without any Scala experience (like me).</p><p>For example:</p><p>var anyGreeting = “Hello world!” // universal greeting<br />val queenGreeting = “How do you do?” // How to greet the Queen (of England)</p><p>// equivalent to<br />var anyGreeting : String = “Hello world!”<br />val queenGreeting : String = “How do you do?”</p><p>vars are mutable and can be changed, vals are immutable and can’t be changed, so:</p><p>anyGreeting = “Kia ora” // hello in Maori<br />queenGreeting = “Ow ya goin mate” // hello in Australian, won’t work as immutable<br />anyGreeting = 3.14159 // won’t work, as anyGreeting is a String</p><p>Let’s revisit the Decision Tree ML code in Scala + DataFrames.</p><p><a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-classification-regression.html#decision-tree-classifier\">Here’s the latest documentation for the Decision Tree Classifier for DataFrames. </a></p><p>As the Instametrics monitoring data we have is in Cassandra we need to read the data into Spark from Cassandra first.

For some reason, the 1st argument to cassandraFormat is the <i>table</i> name, and the 2nd is the <i>keyspace</i>.  This returns (lazily) a DataFrame object.</p><p>val data = spark<br />.read<br />.cassandraFormat(“mllib_wide”, “instametrics”)<br />.load()</p><p>Loading lots of data from Cassandra works well, it’s fast, and DataFrames infers the schema correctly.  The format of the data DataFrame is lots of examples (Rows) with columns as follows (wide table format has each data variable/feature in a separate column):</p><p>&lt;host, bucket_time, label, metric1, metric2, metric3, …&gt;</p><p>Where did this data come from?

The label column was also previously computed and saved (the label is the class to be learned, in this case either 1.0 for positive examples, or 0.0 for negative examples).</p><p>The next trick is to replace null values with something else (e.g. 0), as we run into problems with nulls later on (even though in theory the MLLib algorithms cope with sparse vectors).</p><p>val data2 = data.na.fill(0)</p><p>Here are the relevant documents:</p><p><a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.3.1/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame\">https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.3.1/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame</a></p><p><a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.4.0/api/java/org/apache/spark/sql/DataFrameNaFunctions.html\">https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.4.0/api/java/org/apache/spark/sql/DataFrameNaFunctions.html</a></p><p>As in the previous RDD example we need two subsets of the data, for training and testing:</p><p>val Array(trainingData, testData) = data2.randomSplit(Array(0.7, 0.3))</p><p>Next we need to produce an Array(String) of column names to be used as features. In theory all of the columns can be used as features, except the label column, but in practice some columns are not the correct type for the classifier and must be filtered out (e.g. for this example we can only have Doubles):</p><p>val featureCols = data2.columns.filter(!_.equals(“host”)).filter(!_.equals(“bucket_time”)).filter(!_.equals(“label”))</p><p>Next we need to create a single column of features. VectorAssembler is a transformer that combines a list of columns into a single vector column, which is what we want.  However, it turns out to have problems with null values (which is why we replaced them above).  </p><p>val features = new VectorAssembler()<br />.setInputCols(featureCols)<br />.setOutputCol(“features”)</p><p>Here’s the VectorAssembler documentation:</p><p><a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.0/ml-features.html#vectorassembler\">https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.0/ml-features.html#vectorassembler</a></p><p><a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.0/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler\">https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.0/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler</a></p><p>Next create a DecisionTreeClassifier, with the column to predict as “label”, and the features to use called “features” (from the VectorAssembler above):</p><p>val dt = new DecisionTreeClassifier()<br />.setLabelCol(“label”)<br />.setFeaturesCol(“features”)</p><p>More documentation:</p><p><a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.5.2/ml-decision-tree.html\">https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.5.2/ml-decision-tree.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.0.0/api/java/org/apache/spark/ml/classification/DecisionTreeClassifier.html\">https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.0.0/api/java/org/apache/spark/ml/classification/DecisionTreeClassifier.html</a></p><h2>Pipelines, Tunnels, Wormholes</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Pipelines-tunnels-Wormholes-Instaclustr.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-7422 size-full\" src=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Pipelines-tunnels-Wormholes-Instaclustr.png\" alt=\"Pipelines, tunnels, Wormholes Instaclustr\" width=\"1364\" height=\"964\" srcset=\"https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Pipelines-tunnels-Wormholes-Instaclustr.png 1364w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Pipelines-tunnels-Wormholes-Instaclustr-300x212.png 300w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Pipelines-tunnels-Wormholes-Instaclustr-768x543.png 768w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Pipelines-tunnels-Wormholes-Instaclustr-1024x724.png 1024w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Pipelines-tunnels-Wormholes-Instaclustr-872x616.png 872w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Pipelines-tunnels-Wormholes-Instaclustr-640x452.png 640w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Pipelines-tunnels-Wormholes-Instaclustr-68x48.png 68w, https://24b4dt1v60e526bo2p349l4c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Pipelines-tunnels-Wormholes-Instaclustr-153x108.png 153w\" /></a></p><p>Another new Spark feature is <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.1/ml-pipeline.html\">Pipelines</a> (tunnels, wormholes, etc).  A Pipeline chains multiple Transformers and Estimators together for a ML workflow. A Transformer is an algorithm (feature transformers or learned models) that can transform one DataFrame into another DataFrame (e.g. a ML model transforms a DataFrame with labels and features into a DataFrame with predictions). An Estimator is an algorithm which can be fit on a DataFrame to produce a Model (which is a Transformer). This Pipeline consists of only two stages, features (feature transformer) and dt (estimator) (More on <a href=\"https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-apache-spark/spark-mllib/spark-mllib-models.html#PipelineModel\">stages</a>):</p><p>val pipeline = new Pipeline()<br />.setStages(Array(features, dt))</p><p>Now we actually train the model by calling the pipeline fit method on the trainingData:</p><p>val model = pipeline.fit(trainingData)</p><p>And then test it by applying the model to the testData. This produces a DataFrame with a “predictions” column (by default), a “label” column (actual class), and the “features” column:</p><p>val predictions = model.transform(testData)<br />predictions.select(“prediction”, “label”, “features”)</p><p>  The <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.0.1/api/java/org/apache/spark/ml/evaluation/MulticlassClassificationEvaluator.html\">MulticlassClassificationEvaluator</a> can compute a limited number of evaluation metrics, here’s an example for “accuracy”:</p><p>val evaluator = new MulticlassClassificationEvaluator()<br />        .setLabelCol(“label”)<br />.setPredictionCol(“prediction”)<br />.setMetricName(“accuracy”)</p><p>val accuracy = evaluator.evaluate(predictions)<br />println(“Test Error = ” + (1.0 – accuracy))</p><p>However,  as pointed out the previous blog the model accuracy isn’t a particularly useful metric depending on the actual ratio of positive/negative examples.  We can use the <i>MulticlassMetrics</i> to compute the confusion matrix, precision, and recall. And then also compute the actual rate of negative examples for comparison with the model accuracy metric. <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/mllib/evaluation/MulticlassMetrics.scala\"><i>MulticlassMetrics</i></a> has an auxiliary constructor for DataFrames but I still had to convert to an RDD before use. See <a href=\"https://books.google.com.au/books?id=NJwnDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=MulticlassMetrics+Dataframe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fcuHIgop3m&amp;sig=1-VuKMSYhBGyCGFxhvb2rnGeuA0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJgvnWlefWAhXLwLwKHWNVD6EQ6AEISzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=MulticlassMetrics%20Dataframe&amp;f=false\">this book f</a>or more information and ways of creating a confusion matrix from a DataFrame directly.</p><p>And now print the model out.</p><p>val treeModel = model.stages(1).asInstanceOf[DecisionTreeClassificationModel]<br />println(“Learned classification tree model:\\n” + treeModel.toDebugString)</p><p>The decision tree actually doesn’t make much “sense” as the named features have been replaced by feature numbers (e.g. If (feature 23 &lt;= 8720.749999999996) Predict 0.0 Else etc). Ideally there should be some way of automatically converting them back to the original names.</p><h2>Results</h2><p>Did it work? I’m sorry, I can’t tell you. In theory after going through the wormhole, information flow to the outside world is limited (the telephone didn’t work).  Ok, we’re not really in some virtual reality hotel/zoo at the other end of the universe (probably), and Dave did travel back to this universe, so I can tell you…</p><p>For this example we used real data, but obtained from our pre-production clusters. Rather than pre-process all the raw data I took a shortcut and use the rolled up data which had min, avg and max values computed for every metric over 5 minute periods. However, I forgot to check the bucket_time values, and later discovered that the bucket_time was actually hourly, so I ended up using hours as the default time period for learning. I also noticed that the JVM GC durations had not been rolled up for this snapshot of data, so I used these read and write SLA metrics to compute the label:</p><p>/cassandra/sla/latency/read_avg(avg)<br />/cassandra/sla/latency/read_max(max)<br />/cassandra/sla/latency/write_avg(avg)<br />/cassandra/sla/latency/write_max(max)</p><p>These metrics were combined with thresholds to ensure that about 5% of the examples were positive (i.e. had “long” read/write times). And these metrics were removed from the data before use to prevent cheating by the machine learning algorithm.</p><p>The wide data table read from Cassandra had 1518 examples (rows), which was split into training and test data. The training data set had 1067 examples, but only 60 positive examples (not a huge number for a Big Data problem, and in practice the number of examples needs to be &gt;&gt; the number of features, at least 2x). There were 2839 features (columns).</p><p>Learning only took a few minutes. Model accuracy was 0.96, however, as the negative example rate was 0.95 this isn’t much better than guessing. Precision was 0.60 and Recall was 0.66.</p><p>Is this result any good? A precision of 0.6 means that given a <i>prediction</i> of a SLA violation by the model, it is likely to be correct 60% of the time (but gets it wrong 40% of the time). A recall of 0.66 means that given an <i>actual</i> SLA violation, the model will correctly predict it 66% of the time (i.e. but misses it 34% of the time).  By comparison, using a sample of the data in the previous blog the recall was only 45%, so 66% is an improvement! Assuming that the cost of checking a SLA violation warning (from the model prediction) is minimal, then it’s more important to correctly predict as many actual SLA violations (assuming we can do something to prevent/mitigate them in advance, and that SLA violations are expensive if they occur), and increase the recall accuracy.   How could this be done? More and better quality data (e.g. from production clusters, as pre-production clusters and metrics are somewhat atypical, for example, many nodes may be spun up and down for short time periods, and they don’t have typical user workloads running on them), reducing the number of features (e.g. <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.0/ml-features.html#feature-selectors\">feature selection</a>, by removing redundant or highly correlated features), and different ML algorithms… </p><p>What features did the model pick to use to predict the long SLAs times from the 2839 features available? Only these 11 (which appear to be plausible):</p><ol><li>/cassandra/jvm/memory/heapMemoryUsage/max</li>\n<li>/cassandra/jvm/memory/heapMemoryUsage/used_avg</li>\n<li>/cassandra/metrics/type=ClientRequest/scope=Read/name=Latency/95thPercentile_avg</li>\n<li>/cassandra/metrics/type=ClientRequest/scope=Read/name=Latency/count_max</li>\n<li>/cassandra/metrics/type=ClientRequest/scope=Read/name=Latency/latency_per_operation_avg</li>\n<li>/cassandra/metrics/type=ClientRequest/scope=Write/name=Latency/95thPercentile_avg</li>\n<li>/cassandra/metrics/type=ClientRequest/scope=Write/name=Latency/latency_per_operation_avg</li>\n<li>/cassandra/metrics/type=ColumnFamily/keyspace=test/scope=testuncompressed/name=TotalDiskSpaceUsed_max</li>\n<li>/proc/diskstats/xvda1/sectorsWritten_max</li>\n<li>/proc/diskstats/xvdx/sectorsRead_avg</li>\n<li>/proc/stat/cpu-agg/user_max</li>\n</ol><p>Thanks to Instaclustr people for help (with Instametrics data, support for Cassandra, Spark and Zeppelin, and machine learning discussions) including Christophe, Jordan, Alwyn, Alex_I, Juan, Joe &amp; Jen.</p><h2>Next Blog</h2><p>How did we get here?
